Inherits RefCounted Object Plugin for adding custom parsers to extract strings that are to be translated from custom files csv json etc Description EditorTranslationParserPlugin is invoked when a file is being parsed to extract strings that require translation To define the parsing and string extraction logic override the _parse_file method in script Add the extracted strings to argument msgids or msgids_context_plural if context or plural is used When adding to msgids_context_plural you must add the data using the format A B C where A represents the extracted string B represents the context and C represents the plural version of the extracted string If you want to add only context but not plural put for the plural slot The idea is the same if you only want to add plural but not context See the code below for concrete examples The extracted strings will be written into a POT file selected by user under POT Generation in Localization tab in Project Settings menu Below shows an example

associated with edited scenes Each scene has its own undo history and EditorUndoRedoManager ensures that each action performed in the editor gets associated with a proper scene For actions not related to scenes ProjectSettings edits external resources etc a separate global history is used The usage is mostly the same as UndoRedo You create and commit actions and the manager automatically decides under the hood what scenes it belongs to The scene is deduced based on the first operation in an action using the object from the operation The rules are as follows If the object is a Node use the currently edited scene If the object is a built in resource use the scene from its path If the object is external resource or anything else use global history This guessing can sometimes yield false results so you can provide a custom context object when creating an action EditorUndoRedoManager is intended to be used by Godot editor plugins You can obtain it using EditorPlugin get_undo_redo For non editor uses or plugins that don t need to integrate with the editor s undo history use UndoRedo instead The manager s API is mostly the same as in UndoRedo so you can refer to its documentation for more examples The main difference is that EditorUndoRedoManager uses object method name for actions instead of Callable Methods void add_do_method object Object method StringName vararg void

the address and port currently bound by this ENetConnection instance This is useful as it serves to establish entries in NAT routing tables on all devices between this bound instance and the public facing internet allowing a prospective client s connection packets to be routed backward through the NAT device s between the public internet and this host This requires forward knowledge of a prospective client s address and communication port as seen by the public internet after any NAT devices have handled their connection request This information can be obtained by a STUN service and must be handed off to your host by an entity that is not the prospective client This will never work for a client behind a Symmetric NAT due to the nature of the Symmetric NAT routing algorithm as

limit the incoming and outgoing bandwidth to the given number of bytes per second The default of 0 means unlimited bandwidth Note that ENet will strategically drop packets on specific sides of a

fragmentation increasing the chance of it being dropped Method Descriptions int get_channels const Returns the number of channels allocated for communication with peer String get_remote_address const Returns the IP address of this peer int get_remote_port const Returns the remote port of this peer PeerState get_state const Returns the current peer state See PeerState float get_statistic statistic PeerStatistic Returns the requested statistic for this peer See PeerStatistic bool is_active const Returns true if the peer is currently active i e the associated ENetConnection is still valid void peer_disconnect data int 0 Request a disconnection from a peer An ENetConnection EVENT_DISCONNECT will be generated during ENetConnection service once the disconnection is complete void peer_disconnect_later data int 0 Request a disconnection from a peer but only after all queued outgoing packets are sent An ENetConnection EVENT_DISCONNECT will be generated during ENetConnection service once the disconnection is complete void peer_disconnect_now data int 0 Force an immediate disconnection from a peer No ENetConnection EVENT_DISCONNECT will be generated The foreign peer is not guaranteed to receive the disconnect notification and is reset immediately upon return from this function void ping Sends a ping request to a peer ENet automatically pings all connected peers at regular intervals however this function may be called to ensure more frequent ping requests void ping_interval ping_interval int Sets the ping_interval in milliseconds at which pings will be sent to a peer Pings are used both to monitor the liveness of the connection and also to dynamically adjust the throttle during periods of low traffic so that the throttle has reasonable responsiveness during traffic spikes The default ping interval is 500 milliseconds void reset Forcefully disconnects a peer The foreign host represented by the peer is not notified of the disconnection and will timeout on its connection to the local host Error send channel int packet PackedByteArray flags int Queues a packet to be sent over the specified channel See FLAG_ constants for available packet flags void set_timeout timeout int timeout_min int timeout_max int Sets the timeout parameters for a peer The timeout parameters control how and when a peer will timeout from a failure to acknowledge reliable traffic Timeout values are expressed in milliseconds The timeout is a factor that multiplied by a value based on the average round trip time will determine the timeout limit for a reliable packet When that limit is reached the timeout will be doubled and the peer will be disconnected if that limit has reached timeout_min The timeout_max parameter on the other hand defines a fixed timeout for which any packet must be acknowledged or the peer will be dropped void throttle_configure interval int acceleration int deceleration int Configures throttle parameter for a peer Unreliable packets are dropped by ENet in response to the varying conditions of the Internet connection to the peer The throttle represents a probability that an unreliable packet should not be dropped and thus sent by ENet to the peer By measuring fluctuations in round trip times of reliable packets over the specified interval ENet will either increase the probability by the amount specified in the acceleration parameter or decrease it by the amount specified in the deceleration parameter both are ratios to PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE When the throttle has a value of PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE no unreliable packets are dropped by ENet and so 100 of all unreliable packets will be sent When the throttle has a value of 0 all unreliable packets are dropped by ENet and so 0 of all unreliable packets will be sent Intermediate values for the throttle represent intermediate probabilities between 0 and 100 of unreliable packets being sent The bandwidth limits of the local and foreign hosts are taken into account to determine a sensible limit for the throttle probability above which it should not raise even in the best of conditions User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before

int max_fps 0 void set_max_fps value int int get_max_fps The maximum number of frames that can be rendered every second FPS A value of 0 means the framerate is uncapped Limiting the FPS can be useful to reduce the host machine s power consumption which reduces heat noise emissions and improves battery life If ProjectSettings display window vsync vsync_mode is Enabled or Adaptive the setting takes precedence and the max FPS number cannot exceed the monitor s refresh rate If ProjectSettings display window vsync vsync_mode is Enabled on monitors with variable refresh rate enabled G Sync FreeSync using an FPS limit a few frames lower than the monitor s refresh rate will reduce input lag while avoiding tearing See also physics_ticks_per_second and ProjectSettings application run max_fps Note The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project s logic and rendering Note If ProjectSettings display window vsync vsync_mode is Disabled limiting the FPS to a high value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag compared to an uncapped framerate Since this works by ensuring the GPU load is lower than 100 this latency reduction is only effective in GPU bottlenecked scenarios not CPU bottlenecked scenarios int max_physics_steps_per_frame 8 void set_max_physics_steps_per_frame value int int get_max_physics_steps_per_frame The maximum number of physics steps that can be simulated each rendered frame Note The default value is tuned to prevent expensive physics simulations from triggering even more expensive simulations indefinitely However the game will appear to slow down if the rendering FPS is less than 1 max_physics_steps_per_frame of physics_ticks_per_second This occurs even if delta is consistently used in physics calculations To avoid this increase max_physics_steps_per_frame if you have increased physics_ticks_per_second significantly above its default value float physics_jitter_fix 0 5 void set_physics_jitter_fix value float float get_physics_jitter_fix How much physics ticks are synchronized with real time If 0 or less the ticks are fully synchronized Higher values cause the in game clock to deviate more from the real clock but they smooth out framerate jitters Note The default value of 0 5 should be good enough for most cases values above 2 could cause the game to react to dropped frames with a noticeable delay and are not recommended Note When using a custom physics interpolation solution or within a network game it s recommended to disable the physics jitter fix by setting this property to 0 int physics_ticks_per_second 60 void set_physics_ticks_per_second value int int get_physics_ticks_per_second The number of fixed iterations per second This controls how often physics simulation and Node _physics_process methods are run This value should generally always be set to 60 or above as Godot doesn t interpolate the physics step As a result values lower than 60 will look stuttery This value can be increased to make input more reactive or work around collision tunneling issues but keep in mind doing so will increase CPU usage See also max_fps and ProjectSettings physics common physics_ticks_per_second Note Only max_physics_steps_per_frame physics ticks may be simulated per rendered frame at most If more physics ticks have to be simulated per rendered frame to keep up with rendering the project will appear to slow down even if delta is used consistently in physics calculations Therefore it is recommended to also increase max_physics_steps_per_frame if increasing physics_ticks_per_second significantly above its default value bool print_error_messages true void set_print_error_messages value bool bool is_printing_error_messages If false stops printing error and warning messages to the console and editor Output log This can be used to hide error and warning messages during unit test suite runs This property is equivalent to the ProjectSettings application run disable_stderr project setting Note This property does not impact the editor s Errors tab when running a project from the editor Warning If set to false anywhere in the project important error messages may be hidden even if they are emitted from other scripts In a tool script this will also impact the editor itself Do not report bugs before ensuring error messages are enabled as they are by default float time_scale 1 0 void set_time_scale value float float get_time_scale The speed multiplier at which the in game clock updates compared to real time For example if set to 2 0 the game runs twice as fast and if set to 0 5 the game runs half as fast This value affects Timer SceneTreeTimer and all other simulations that make use of delta time such as Node _process and Node _physics_process Note It s recommended to keep this property above 0 0 as the game may behave unexpectedly otherwise Note This does not affect audio playback speed Use AudioServer playback_speed_scale to adjust audio playback speed independently of time_scale Note This does not automatically adjust physics_ticks_per_second With values above 1 0 physics simulation may become less precise as each physics tick will stretch over a larger period of engine time If you re modifying time_scale to speed up simulation by a large factor consider also increasing physics_ticks_per_second to make the simulation more reliable Method Descriptions String get_architecture_name const Returns the name of the CPU architecture the Godot binary was built for Possible return values include x86_64 x86_32 arm64 arm32 rv64 riscv ppc64 ppc wasm64 and wasm32 To detect whether the current build is 64 bit you can use the fact that all 64 bit architecture names

close when it s freed which happens when it goes out of scope or when it gets assigned with null close can be used to close it before then explicitly In C the reference must be disposed manually which can be done with the using statement or by calling the Dispose method directly Note To access project resources once exported it is recommended to use ResourceLoader instead of FileAccess as some files are converted to engine specific formats and their original source files might not be present in the exported PCK package Note Files are automatically closed only if the process exits normally such as by clicking the window manager s close button or pressing Alt F4 If you stop the project execution by pressing F8 while the project is running the file won t be closed as the game process will

Restricted deletion sticky bit Property Descriptions bool big_endian void set_big_endian value bool bool is_big_endian If true the file is read with big endian endianness If false the file is read with little endian endianness If in doubt leave this to false as most files are written with little endian endianness Note big_endian is only about the file format not the CPU type The CPU endianness doesn t affect the default endianness for files written Note This is always reset to false whenever you open the file Therefore you must set big_endian after opening the file not before Method Descriptions void close Closes the currently opened file and prevents subsequent read write operations Use flush to persist the data to disk without closing the file Note FileAccess will automatically close when it s freed which happens when it goes out of scope or when it gets assigned with null In C the reference must be disposed after we are done using it this can be done with the using statement or calling the Dispose method directly bool eof_reached const Returns true if the file cursor has already read past the end of the file Note eof_reached false cannot be used to check whether there is more data available To loop while there is more data available use GDScript C while file get_position file get_length Read data Copy to clipboard while file GetPosition file GetLength Read data Copy to clipboard bool file_exists path String static Returns true if the file exists in the given path Note Many resources types are imported e g textures or sound files and their source asset will not be included in the exported game as only the imported version is used See ResourceLoader exists for an alternative approach that takes resource remapping into account For a non static relative equivalent use DirAccess file_exists void flush Writes the file s buffer to disk Flushing is automatically performed when the file is closed This means you don t need to call flush manually before closing a file Still calling flush can be used to ensure the data is safe even if the project crashes instead of being closed gracefully Note Only call flush when you actually need it Otherwise it will decrease performance due to constant disk writes int get_8 const Returns the next 8 bits from the file as an integer See store_8 for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way

use other than the default comma This delimiter must be one character long and cannot be a double quotation mark Text is interpreted as being UTF 8 encoded Text values must be enclosed in double quotes if they include the delimiter character Double quotes within a text value can be escaped by doubling their occurrence For example the following CSV lines are valid and will be properly parsed as two strings each Alice Hello Bob Bob Alice What a surprise Alice I thought you d reply with Hello world Copy to clipboard Note how the second line can omit the enclosing quotes as it does not include the delimiter However it could very well use quotes it was only written without for demonstration purposes The third line must use for each quotation mark that needs to be interpreted as such

open an issue HTTPClient Inherits RefCounted Object Low level hyper text transfer protocol client Description Hyper text transfer protocol client sometimes called User Agent Used to make HTTP requests to download web content upload files and other data or to communicate with various services among other use cases See the HTTPRequest node for a higher level alternative Note This client only needs to connect to a host once see connect_to_host to send multiple requests Because of this methods that take URLs usually take just the part after the host instead of the full URL as the client is already connected to a host See request for a full example and to get started A HTTPClient should be reused between multiple requests or to connect to different hosts instead of creating one client per request Supports Transport Layer Security TLS including server certificate verification HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate success 3xx redirection i e try again but over here 4xx something was wrong with the request and 5xx something went wrong on the server s side For more information on HTTP see MDN s documentation on HTTP or read RFC 2616 to get it straight from the source Note When exporting to Android make sure to enable the INTERNET permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one click deploy Otherwise network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android Note It s recommended to use transport encryption TLS and to avoid sending sensitive information such as login credentials in HTTP GET URL parameters Consider using HTTP POST requests or HTTP headers for such information instead Note When performing HTTP requests from a project exported to Web keep in mind the remote server may not allow requests from foreign origins due to CORS If you host the server in question you should modify its backend to allow requests from foreign origins by adding the Access Control Allow Origin HTTP header Note TLS support is currently limited to TLS 1 0 TLS 1 1 and TLS 1 2 Attempting to connect to a TLS 1 3 only server will return an error Warning TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not supported

HTTP HEAD method The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request but without the response body This is useful to request metadata like HTTP headers or to check if a resource exists Method METHOD_POST 2 HTTP POST method The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource often causing a change in state or side effects on the server This is often used for forms and submitting data or uploading files Method METHOD_PUT 3 HTTP PUT method The PUT method asks to replace all current representations of the target resource with the request payload You can think of POST as create or update and PUT as update although many services tend to not make a clear distinction or change their meaning Method METHOD_DELETE 4 HTTP DELETE method The DELETE method requests to delete the specified resource Method METHOD_OPTIONS 5 HTTP OPTIONS method The OPTIONS method asks for a description of the communication options for the target resource Rarely used Method METHOD_TRACE 6 HTTP TRACE method The TRACE method performs a message loop back test along the path to the target resource Returns the entire HTTP request received in the response body Rarely used Method METHOD_CONNECT 7 HTTP CONNECT method The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource Rarely used Method METHOD_PATCH 8 HTTP PATCH method The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource Method METHOD_MAX 9 Represents the size of the Method enum enum Status Status STATUS_DISCONNECTED 0 Status Disconnected from the server Status

has been created as a result of it This is typically the response sent after a PUT request ResponseCode RESPONSE_ACCEPTED 202 HTTP status code 202 Accepted The request has been received but not yet acted upon It is non committal meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request or for batch processing ResponseCode RESPONSE_NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION 203 HTTP status code 203 Non Authoritative Information This response code means returned meta information set is not exact set as available from the origin server but collected from a local or a third party copy Except this condition 200 OK response should be preferred instead of this response ResponseCode RESPONSE_NO_CONTENT 204 HTTP status code 204 No Content There is no content to send for this request but the headers may be useful The user agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones ResponseCode RESPONSE_RESET_CONTENT 205 HTTP status code 205 Reset Content The server has fulfilled the request and desires that the client resets the document view that caused the request to be sent to its original state as received from the origin server ResponseCode RESPONSE_PARTIAL_CONTENT 206 HTTP status code 206 Partial Content This response

changed The new URI is usually included in the response ResponseCode RESPONSE_FOUND 302 HTTP status code 302 Found Temporary redirection This response code means the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily New changes in the URI might be made in the future Therefore this same URI should be used by the client in future requests ResponseCode RESPONSE_SEE_OTHER 303 HTTP status code 303 See Other The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource as indicated by a URI in the Location header field which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original request ResponseCode RESPONSE_NOT_MODIFIED 304 HTTP status code 304 Not Modified A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 OK response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false ResponseCode RESPONSE_USE_PROXY 305 Deprecated Many clients ignore this response code for security reasons It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard HTTP status code 305 Use Proxy ResponseCode RESPONSE_SWITCH_PROXY 306 Deprecated Many clients ignore this response code for security reasons It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard HTTP status code 306 Switch

ResponseCode RESPONSE_UNAUTHORIZED 401 HTTP status code 401 Unauthorized Credentials required The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource ResponseCode RESPONSE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED 402 HTTP status code 402 Payment Required This response code is reserved for future use Initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems however this is not currently used ResponseCode RESPONSE_FORBIDDEN 403 HTTP status code 403 Forbidden The client does not have access rights to the content i e they are unauthorized so server is rejecting to give proper response Unlike 401 the client s identity is known to the server ResponseCode RESPONSE_NOT_FOUND 404 HTTP status code 404 Not Found The server can not find requested resource Either the URL is not recognized or the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist May also be sent instead of 403 to hide existence of a resource if the client is not authorized ResponseCode RESPONSE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED 405 HTTP status code 405 Method Not Allowed The request s HTTP method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used For example an

set_use_accumulated_input value bool bool is_using_accumulated_input If true similar input events sent by the operating system are accumulated When input accumulation is enabled all input events generated during a frame will be merged and emitted when the frame is done rendering Therefore this limits the number of input method calls per second to the rendering FPS Input accumulation can be disabled to get slightly more precise reactive input at the cost of increased CPU usage In applications where drawing freehand lines is required input accumulation should generally be disabled while the user is drawing the line to get results that closely follow the actual input Note Input accumulation is enabled by default Method Descriptions void action_press action StringName strength float 1 0 This will simulate pressing the specified action The strength can be used for non boolean actions it s ranged between 0 and 1 representing the intensity of the given action Note This method will not cause any Node _input calls It is intended to be used with is_action_pressed and is_action_just_pressed If you want to simulate _input use parse_input_event instead void action_release action StringName If the specified action is already pressed this will release it void add_joy_mapping mapping String update_existing bool false Adds a new mapping entry in SDL2 format to the mapping database Optionally update already connected devices void flush_buffered_events Sends all input events which are in the current buffer to the game loop These events may have been buffered as a result of accumulated input use_accumulated_input or agile input flushing ProjectSettings input_devices buffering agile_event_flushing The engine will already do this itself at key execution points at least once per frame However this can be useful in advanced cases where you want precise control over the timing of event handling Vector3 get_accelerometer const Returns the acceleration in m s² of the device s accelerometer sensor if the device has one Otherwise the method returns Vector3 ZERO Note this method returns an empty Vector3 when running from the editor even when your device has an accelerometer You must export your project to a supported device to read values from the accelerometer Note This method only works on Android and iOS On other platforms it always returns Vector3 ZERO float get_action_raw_strength action StringName exact_match bool false const Returns a value between 0 and 1 representing the raw intensity of the given action ignoring the action s deadzone In most cases you should use get_action_strength instead If exact_match is false it ignores additional input modifiers for InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events and the direction for InputEventJoypadMotion events float get_action_strength action StringName exact_match bool false const Returns a value between 0 and 1 representing the intensity of the given action In a joypad for example the further away the axis analog sticks or L2 R2 triggers is from the dead zone the closer the value will be to 1 If the action is mapped to a control that has no axis such as the keyboard the value returned will be 0 or 1 If exact_match is false it ignores additional input modifiers for InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events and the direction for InputEventJoypadMotion events float get_axis negative_action StringName positive_action StringName const Get axis input by specifying two actions one negative and one positive This is a shorthand for writing Input get_action_strength

SDL2 compatible device GUID on platforms that use gamepad remapping e g 030000004c050000c405000000010000 Returns Default Gamepad otherwise Godot uses the SDL2 game controller database to determine gamepad names and mappings based on this GUID Dictionary get_joy_info device int const Returns a dictionary with extra platform specific information about the device e g the raw gamepad name from the OS or the Steam Input index On Windows the dictionary contains the following fields xinput_index The index of the controller in the XInput system On Linux raw_name The name of the controller as it came from the OS before getting renamed by the godot controller database vendor_id The USB vendor ID of the device product_id The USB product ID of the device steam_input_index The Steam Input gamepad

get_last_mouse_velocity Returns the last mouse velocity To provide a precise and jitter free velocity mouse velocity is only calculated every 0 1s Therefore mouse velocity will lag mouse movements Vector3 get_magnetometer const Returns the magnetic field strength in micro Tesla for all axes of the device s magnetometer sensor if the device has one Otherwise the method returns Vector3 ZERO Note This method only works on Android and iOS On other platforms it always returns Vector3 ZERO BitField MouseButtonMask get_mouse_button_mask const Returns mouse buttons as a bitmask If multiple mouse buttons are pressed at the same time the bits are added together Equivalent to DisplayServer mouse_get_button_state Vector2 get_vector negative_x StringName positive_x StringName negative_y StringName positive_y StringName deadzone float 1 0 const Gets an input vector by specifying four actions for the positive and negative X and Y axes This method is useful when getting vector input such as from a joystick directional pad arrows or WASD The vector has its length limited to 1 and has a circular deadzone which is useful for using vector input as movement By default the deadzone is automatically calculated from the average of the action deadzones However you can override the deadzone to be whatever you want on the range of 0 to 1 bool is_action_just_pressed action StringName exact_match bool false const Returns true when the user has started pressing the action event in the current frame or physics tick It will only return true on the frame or tick that the user pressed down the button This is useful for code that needs to run only once when an action is pressed instead of every frame while it s pressed If exact_match is false it ignores additional input modifiers for InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events and the direction for InputEventJoypadMotion events Note Returning true does not imply that the action is still pressed An action can be pressed and released again rapidly and true will still be returned so as not to miss input Note Due to keyboard ghosting is_action_just_pressed may return false even if one of the action s keys is pressed See Input examples in the documentation for more information Note During input handling e g Node _input use InputEvent is_action_pressed instead to query the action state of the current event bool is_action_just_released action StringName exact_match bool false const Returns true when the user stops pressing the action event in the current frame or physics tick It will only return true on the frame or tick that the user releases the button Note Returning true does not imply that the action is still not pressed An action can be released and pressed again rapidly and true will still be returned so as not to miss input If exact_match is false it ignores additional input modifiers for InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events and the direction for InputEventJoypadMotion events Note During input handling e g Node _input use InputEvent is_action_released instead to query the action state of the current event bool is_action_pressed action StringName exact_match bool false const Returns true if you are pressing the action event If exact_match is false it ignores additional input modifiers for InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events and the direction for InputEventJoypadMotion events Note Due to keyboard ghosting is_action_pressed may return false even if one of the action s keys is pressed See Input examples in the documentation for more information bool is_anything_pressed const Returns true if any action key joypad button or mouse button is being pressed This will also return true if any action is simulated via code by calling action_press bool is_joy_button_pressed device int button JoyButton const Returns true if you are pressing the joypad button see JoyButton bool is_joy_known device int Returns true if the system knows the specified device This means that it sets all button and axis indices Unknown joypads are not expected to match these constants but you can still retrieve events from them bool is_key_label_pressed keycode Key const Returns true if you are pressing the key with the keycode printed on it You can pass a Key constant or any Unicode character code bool is_key_pressed keycode Key const Returns true if you are pressing the Latin key in the current keyboard layout You can pass a Key constant is_key_pressed is only recommended over is_physical_key_pressed in non game applications This ensures that shortcut keys behave as expected depending on the user s keyboard layout as keyboard shortcuts are generally dependent on the keyboard layout in non game applications If in doubt use is_physical_key_pressed Note Due to keyboard ghosting is_key_pressed may return false even if one of the action s keys is pressed See Input examples in the documentation for more information bool is_mouse_button_pressed button MouseButton const Returns true if you are pressing the mouse button specified with MouseButton bool is_physical_key_pressed keycode Key const Returns true if you are pressing the key in the physical location on the 101 102 key US QWERTY keyboard You can pass a Key constant is_physical_key_pressed is recommended over is_key_pressed for in game actions as it will make W A S D layouts work regardless of the user s keyboard layout is_physical_key_pressed will also ensure that the top row number keys work on any keyboard layout If in doubt use is_physical_key_pressed Note Due to keyboard ghosting is_physical_key_pressed may return false even if one of the action s keys is pressed See Input examples in the documentation for more information void parse_input_event event InputEvent Feeds an InputEvent to the game Can be used to artificially trigger input events from code Also generates Node _input calls Example GDScript C var cancel_event InputEventAction new cancel_event action ui_cancel cancel_event pressed true Input parse_input_event cancel_event Copy to clipboard var cancelEvent new InputEventAction cancelEvent Action ui_cancel cancelEvent Pressed true Input ParseInputEvent cancelEvent Copy to clipboard Note Calling this function has no influence on the operating system So for example sending an InputEventMouseMotion will not move the OS mouse cursor to the specified position use warp_mouse instead and sending Alt Cmd Tab as InputEventKey won t toggle between active windows void remove_joy_mapping guid String Removes all mappings from the internal database that match the given GUID void set_accelerometer value Vector3 Sets the acceleration value of the accelerometer sensor Can be used for debugging on devices without a hardware sensor for example in an editor on a PC Note This value can be immediately overwritten by the hardware sensor value on Android and iOS void set_custom_mouse_cursor image Resource shape CursorShape 0 hotspot Vector2 Vector2 0 0 Sets a custom mouse cursor image which is only visible inside the game window The hotspot can also be specified Passing null to the image parameter resets to the system cursor See CursorShape for the list of shapes image can be either Texture2D or Image and its size must be lower than or equal to 256 256 To avoid rendering issues sizes lower than or equal to 128 128 are recommended hotspot must be within image s size Note AnimatedTexture s aren t supported as custom mouse cursors If using an AnimatedTexture only the first frame will be displayed Note The Lossless Lossy or Uncompressed compression modes are recommended The Video RAM compression mode can be used but it will be decompressed on the CPU which means loading times are slowed down and no memory is saved compared to lossless modes Note On the web platform the maximum allowed cursor image size is 128 128 Cursor images larger than 32 32 will also only be displayed if the mouse cursor image is entirely located within the page for security reasons void set_default_cursor_shape shape CursorShape 0 Sets the default cursor shape to be used in the viewport instead of CURSOR_ARROW Note If you want to change the default cursor shape for Control s nodes use Control mouse_default_cursor_shape instead Note This method generates an InputEventMouseMotion to update cursor immediately void set_gravity value Vector3 Sets the gravity value of the accelerometer sensor Can be used for debugging on devices without a hardware sensor for example in an editor on a PC Note This value can be immediately overwritten by the hardware sensor value on Android and iOS void set_gyroscope value Vector3 Sets the value of the rotation rate of the gyroscope sensor Can be used for debugging on devices without a hardware sensor for example in an editor on a PC Note This value can be immediately overwritten by the hardware sensor value on Android and iOS void set_magnetometer value Vector3 Sets the value of the magnetic field of the magnetometer sensor Can be used for debugging on devices without a hardware sensor for example in an editor on a PC Note This value can be immediately overwritten by the hardware sensor value on Android and iOS bool should_ignore_device vendor_id int product_id int const Queries whether an input device should be ignored or not Devices can be ignored by setting the environment variable SDL_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES Read the SDL documentation for more information Note Some 3rd party tools can contribute to the list of ignored devices For example SteamInput creates virtual devices from physical devices for remapping purposes To avoid handling the same input device twice the original device is added to the ignore list void start_joy_vibration device int weak_magnitude float strong_magnitude float duration float 0 Starts to vibrate the joypad Joypads usually come with two rumble motors a strong and a weak one weak_magnitude is the strength of the weak motor between 0 and 1 and strong_magnitude is the strength of the strong motor between 0 and 1 duration is the duration of the effect in seconds a duration of 0 will try to play the vibration indefinitely The vibration can be stopped early by calling stop_joy_vibration Note Not every hardware is compatible with long effect durations it is recommended to restart an effect if it has to be played for more than a few seconds Note For macOS vibration is only supported in macOS 11 and later void stop_joy_vibration device int Stops the vibration of the joypad started with start_joy_vibration void vibrate_handheld duration_ms int 500 amplitude float 1 0 Vibrate the handheld device for the specified duration in milliseconds amplitude is the strength of the vibration as a value between 0 0 and 1 0 If set to 1 0 the default vibration strength of the device is used Note This method is implemented on Android iOS and Web It has no effect on other platforms Note For Android vibrate_handheld requires enabling the VIBRATE permission in the export preset Otherwise vibrate_handheld will have no effect Note For iOS specifying the duration is only supported in iOS 13 and later Note For Web the amplitude cannot be changed Note Some web browsers such as Safari and Firefox for Android do not support vibrate_handheld void warp_mouse position Vector2 Sets the mouse position to the specified vector provided in pixels and relative to an origin at the upper left corner of the currently focused Window Manager game window Mouse position is clipped to the limits of the screen resolution or to the limits of the game window if MouseMode is set to MOUSE_MODE_CONFINED or MOUSE_MODE_CONFINED_HIDDEN Note warp_mouse is only supported on Windows

Like the fixed fps command line argument this forces the reported delta in Node _process functions to be identical across frames regardless of how long it actually took to render the frame This can be used to record high quality videos with perfect frame pacing regardless of your hardware s capabilities Godot has 2 built in MovieWriter s AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio avi file extension Lossy compression medium file sizes fast encoding The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing ProjectSettings editor movie_writer mjpeg_quality The resulting file can be viewed in most video players but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with VideoStreamPlayer MJPEG does not support transparency AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in size at most PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio png file extension Lossless compression large file sizes slow encoding Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as FFmpeg after recording Transparency is currently not supported even if the root viewport is set to be transparent If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third party software you can extend the MovieWriter class to create your own movie writers This should typically be done using GDExtension for performance reasons Editor usage A default movie file path can be specified in ProjectSettings editor movie_writer movie_file Alternatively for running single scenes a movie_file metadata can be added to the root node specifying the path to a movie file that will be used when recording that scene Once a path is set click the video reel icon in the top right corner of the editor to enable Movie Maker mode then run any scene as usual The engine will start recording as soon as the splash screen is finished and it will only stop recording when the engine quits Click the video reel icon again to disable Movie Maker mode Note that toggling Movie Maker mode does not affect project instances that are already running Note MovieWriter is available for use in both the editor and exported projects but it is not designed for use by end users to record videos while playing Players wishing to record gameplay videos should install tools such as OBS Studio or SimpleScreenRecorder instead Methods int _get_audio_mix_rate virtual const SpeakerMode

implementations See also MultiplayerPeer By default SceneTree has a reference to an implementation of this class and uses it to provide multiplayer capabilities i e RPCs across the whole scene It is possible to override the MultiplayerAPI instance used by specific tree branches by calling the SceneTree set_multiplayer method effectively allowing to run both client and server in the same scene It is also possible to extend or replace the default implementation via scripting or native extensions See MultiplayerAPIExtension for details about extensions SceneMultiplayer for the details about the

get_transfer_channel The channel to use to send packets Many network APIs such as ENet and WebRTC allow the creation of multiple independent channels which behaves in a way like separate connections This means that reliable data will only block delivery of other packets on that channel and ordering will only be in respect to the channel the packet is being sent on Using different channels to send different and independent state updates is a common way to optimize network usage and decrease latency in fast paced games Note The default channel 0 actually works as 3 separate channels one for each

synchronization mutex mutual exclusion This is used to synchronize multiple Thread s and is equivalent to a binary Semaphore It guarantees that only one thread can access a critical section at a time This is a reentrant mutex meaning that it can be locked multiple times by one thread provided it also unlocks it as many times Warning Mutexes must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks Warning To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks the following conditions must be met When a Mutex s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed no threads including the one on which the destruction will happen must have it locked When a Thread s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed it must not have any mutex locked Tutorials Using multiple threads Thread safe APIs Methods void lock bool try_lock void unlock Method Descriptions void lock Locks this Mutex blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner Note This function returns without blocking if the thread already has ownership of the mutex bool try_lock Tries locking this Mutex but does not block Returns true on success false otherwise Note This function returns true if the thread already has ownership of the mutex void unlock Unlocks this Mutex leaving it to other threads Note If a thread called lock or try_lock multiple times while already having ownership of the mutex it must also call unlock the same number of times in order to unlock it correctly Warning Calling unlock more times that lock on a given thread thus ending up trying to unlock a non locked mutex is wrong and may causes crashes or deadlocks User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before submitting a comment Up to date This page is up to date for Godot 4 3 If you still find outdated

clearing navigation meshes Description This class is responsible for creating and clearing 3D navigation meshes used as NavigationMesh resources inside NavigationRegion3D The NavigationMeshGenerator has very limited to no use for 2D as the navigation mesh baking process expects 3D node types and 3D source geometry to parse The entire navigation mesh baking is best done in a separate thread as the voxelization collision tests and mesh optimization steps involved are very slow and performance intensive operations Navigation mesh baking happens in multiple steps and the result depends on 3D source geometry and properties of the NavigationMesh resource In the first step starting from a root node and depending on NavigationMesh properties all valid 3D source geometry nodes are collected from the SceneTree Second all collected nodes are parsed for their relevant 3D geometry data and a combined 3D mesh is build Due to the many different types of parsable objects from normal MeshInstance3D s to CSGShape3D s or various CollisionObject3D s some operations to collect geometry data can trigger RenderingServer and PhysicsServer3D synchronizations Server synchronization can have a negative effect on baking time or framerate as it often involves Mutex locking for thread security Many parsable objects and the continuous synchronization with other threaded Servers can increase the baking time significantly On the other hand only a few but very large and complex objects will take some time to prepare for the Servers which can noticeably stall the next frame render As a general rule the total number of parsable objects and their individual size and complexity should be balanced to avoid framerate issues or very long baking times The combined mesh is then passed to the Recast Navigation Object to test the source geometry for walkable terrain suitable to NavigationMesh agent properties by creating a voxel world around the meshes bounding area The finalized navigation mesh is then returned and stored inside the NavigationMesh for use as a resource inside NavigationRegion3D nodes Note Using meshes to not only define walkable surfaces but also obstruct navigation baking does not always work The navigation baking has no concept of what is a geometry inside when dealing with mesh source geometry and this is intentional Depending on current baking parameters as soon as the obstructing mesh is large enough to fit a navigation mesh area inside the baking will generate navigation mesh areas that are inside the obstructing source geometry mesh

core threading changes To upgrade existing code first create a NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D resource Use this resource with parse_source_geometry_data to parse the SceneTree for nodes that should contribute to the navigation mesh baking The SceneTree parsing needs to happen on the main thread After the parsing is finished use the resource with bake_from_source_geometry_data to bake a navigation mesh Bakes the navigation_mesh with source geometry collected starting from the root_node void bake_from_source_geometry_data navigation_mesh NavigationMesh source_geometry_data NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D callback Callable Callable Bakes the provided navigation_mesh with the data from the provided source_geometry_data After the process is finished the optional callback will be called void clear navigation_mesh NavigationMesh Removes all polygons and vertices from the provided navigation_mesh resource void parse_source_geometry_data navigation_mesh NavigationMesh source_geometry_data NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D root_node Node callback Callable Callable Parses the SceneTree for source geometry according to the properties of navigation_mesh Updates the provided source_geometry_data resource with the resulting data The resource can then be used to bake a navigation mesh with bake_from_source_geometry_data After the process is finished the optional callback will be called Note This function needs to run on the main thread or with a deferred call as the SceneTree is not thread safe Performance While convenient reading data arrays from Mesh resources can affect the frame rate negatively The data needs to be received from the GPU stalling the RenderingServer in the process For performance prefer the use of e g collision shapes or

interface for low level 2D navigation access Description NavigationServer2D is the server that handles navigation maps regions and agents It does not handle A navigation from AStar2D or AStarGrid2D Maps are divided into regions which are composed of navigation polygons Together they define the traversable areas in the 2D world Note Most NavigationServer2D changes take effect after the next physics frame and not immediately This includes all changes made to maps regions or agents by navigation related nodes in the scene tree or made through scripts For two regions to be connected to each other they must share a similar edge An edge is considered connected to another if both of its two vertices are at a distance less than edge_connection_margin to the respective other edge s vertex You may assign navigation layers to regions with region_set_navigation_layers which then can be checked upon when requesting a path with map_get_path This can be used to allow or deny certain areas for some objects To use the collision avoidance system you may use agents You can set an agent s target velocity then the servers will emit a callback with a modified velocity Note The collision avoidance system ignores regions Using the modified velocity directly may move an agent outside of the traversable area This is a limitation of the collision avoidance system any more complex situation may require the use of the physics engine This server keeps tracks of any call and executes them during the sync phase This means that you can request any change to the map using any thread without

new map void map_force_update map RID This function immediately forces synchronization of the specified navigation map RID By default navigation maps are only synchronized at the end of each physics frame This function can be used to immediately re calculate all the navigation meshes and region connections of the navigation map This makes it possible to query a navigation path for a changed map immediately and in the same frame multiple times if needed Due to technical restrictions the current NavigationServer command queue will be flushed This means all already queued update commands for this physics frame will be executed even those intended for other maps regions and agents not part of the specified map The expensive computation of the navigation meshes and region connections of a map will only be done for the specified map Other maps will receive the normal synchronization at the end of the physics frame Should the specified map receive changes after the forced update it will update again as well when the other maps receive their update Avoidance processing and dispatch of the safe_velocity signals is unaffected by this function and continues to happen for all maps and agents at the end of the physics frame Note With great power comes great responsibility This function should only be used by users that really know what they are doing and have a good reason for it

you still find outdated information please open an issue NavigationServer3D Experimental This class may be changed or removed in future versions Inherits Object A server interface for low level 3D navigation access Description NavigationServer3D is the server that handles navigation maps regions and agents It does not handle A navigation from AStar3D Maps are divided into regions which are composed of navigation meshes Together they define the navigable areas in the 3D world Note Most NavigationServer3D changes take effect after the next physics frame and not immediately This includes all changes made to maps regions or agents by navigation related nodes in the scene tree or made through scripts For two regions to be connected to each other they must share a similar edge An edge is considered connected to another if both of its two vertices are at a distance less than edge_connection_margin to the respective other edge s vertex You may assign navigation layers to regions with region_set_navigation_layers which then can be checked upon when requesting a path with map_get_path This can be used to allow or deny certain areas for some objects To use the collision avoidance system you may use agents You can set an agent s target velocity then the servers will emit a callback with a modified velocity Note The collision avoidance system ignores regions Using the modified velocity directly may move an agent outside of the traversable area This is a limitation of the collision avoidance system any more complex situation may require the use of the physics engine This server keeps tracks of any call and executes them during the sync phase This means that you can request any change to the map using any thread without worrying Tutorials Using NavigationServer 3D

current position or above their current position including the agents height in 2D avoidance void agent_set_velocity agent RID velocity Vector3 Sets velocity as the new wanted velocity for the specified agent The avoidance simulation will try to fulfill this velocity if possible but will modify it to avoid collision with other agent s and obstacles When an agent is teleported to a new

By default navigation maps are only synchronized at the end of each physics frame This function can be used to immediately re calculate all the navigation meshes and region connections of the navigation map This makes it possible to query a navigation path for a changed map immediately and in the same frame multiple times if needed Due to technical restrictions the current NavigationServer command queue will be flushed This means all already queued update commands for this physics frame will be executed even those intended for other maps regions and agents not part of the specified map The expensive computation of the navigation meshes and region connections of a map will only be done for the specified map Other maps will receive the normal synchronization at the end of the physics frame Should the specified map receive changes after the forced update it will update again as well when the other maps receive their update Avoidance processing and dispatch of the safe_velocity signals is unaffected by this function and continues to happen for all maps and agents at the end of the physics frame Note With great power comes great responsibility This function should only be used by users that really know what they are doing and have a good reason for it Forcing an immediate update of a navigation map requires locking the NavigationServer and flushing the entire

interaction profile paths to new paths to maintain backwards compatibility with older action maps void register_top_level_path display_name String openxr_path String openxr_extension_name String Registers a top level path to which profiles can be bound For instance user hand left refers to the bind point for the player s left hand Extensions can register additional top level paths for instance a haptic vest extension might register user body vest display_name is the name shown to the user openxr_path is the top level path being registered openxr_extension_name is optional and ensures the top level path is only used if the specified extension is available enabled When a top level path ends up being bound by OpenXR a XRPositionalTracker is instantiated to manage the state of

arguments can be supplied To restart the project with the same command line arguments as originally used to run the project pass get_cmdline_args as the value for arguments This method can be used to apply setting changes that require a restart See also is_restart_on_exit_set and get_restart_on_exit_arguments Note This method is only effective on desktop platforms and only when the project isn t started from the editor It will have no effect on mobile and Web platforms or when the project is started from the editor Note If the project process crashes or is killed by the user by sending SIGKILL instead of the usual SIGTERM the project won t restart automatically Error set_thread_name name String Assigns the given name to the current thread Returns GlobalScope ERR_UNAVAILABLE if unavailable on the current platform void set_use_file_access_save_and_swap enabled bool If enabled is true when opening a file for writing a temporary file is used in its place When closed it is

Descriptions Error bind port int bind_address String recv_buf_size int 65536 Binds this PacketPeerUDP to the specified port and bind_address with a buffer size recv_buf_size allowing it to receive incoming packets If bind_address is set to default the peer will be bound on all available addresses both IPv4 and IPv6 If bind_address is set to 0 0 0 0 for IPv4 or for IPv6 the peer will be bound to all available addresses matching that IP type If bind_address is set to any valid address e g 192 168 1 101 1 etc the peer will only be bound to the interface with that address or fail if no interface with the given address exists void close Closes the PacketPeerUDP s underlying UDP socket Error connect_to_host host String port int Calling this method connects this UDP peer to the given host port pair UDP is in reality connectionless so this option only means that incoming packets from different addresses are automatically discarded and that outgoing packets are always sent to the connected address future calls to set_dest_address are not allowed This method does not send any data to the remote peer to do that use PacketPeer put_var or PacketPeer put_packet as usual See also UDPServer Note Connecting to the remote peer does not help to protect from malicious attacks like IP spoofing etc Think about using an encryption technique like TLS or DTLS if you feel like your application is

Inherited By PhysicsServer2DExtension A server interface for low level 2D physics access Description PhysicsServer2D is the server responsible for all 2D physics It can directly create and manipulate all physics objects A space is a self contained world for a physics simulation It contains bodies areas and joints Its state can be queried for collision and intersection information and several parameters of the simulation can be modified A shape is a geometric shape such as a circle a rectangle a capsule or a polygon It can be used for collision detection by adding it to a body area possibly with an extra transformation relative to the body area s origin Bodies areas can have multiple transformed shapes added to them and a single shape can be added to bodies areas multiple times with different local transformations A body is a physical object which can be in static kinematic or rigid mode Its state such as position and velocity can be queried and updated A force integration callback can be set to customize the body s physics An area is a region in space which can be used to detect bodies and areas entering and exiting it A body monitoring callback can be set to report entering exiting body shapes and similarly an area monitoring callback can be set Gravity and damping can be overridden within the area by setting area parameters A joint is a constraint either between two bodies or on one body relative to a point Parameters such as the joint bias and the rest length of a spring joint can be adjusted Physics objects in PhysicsServer2D may be created and manipulated independently they do not have to be tied to nodes in the scene tree Note All the 2D physics nodes use the physics server internally Adding a physics node to the scene tree will cause a corresponding physics object to be created in the physics server A rigid body node registers a callback that updates the node s transform with the transform of the respective body object in the physics server every physics update An area node registers a callback to inform the area node about overlaps with the respective area object in the physics server The raycast node queries the direct state of the relevant space in the physics server Methods void area_add_shape area RID shape RID transform Transform2D Transform2D 1 0 0 1 0 0 disabled bool false void area_attach_canvas_instance_id

PhysicsServer3DExtension A server interface for low level 3D physics access Description PhysicsServer3D is the server responsible for all 3D physics It can directly create and manipulate all physics objects A space is a self contained world for a physics simulation It contains bodies areas and joints Its state can be queried for collision and intersection information and several parameters of the simulation can be modified A shape is a geometric shape such as a sphere a box a cylinder or a polygon It can be used for collision detection by adding it to a body area possibly with an extra transformation relative to the body area s origin Bodies areas can have multiple transformed shapes added to them and a single shape can be added to bodies areas multiple times with different local transformations A body is a physical object which can be in static kinematic or rigid mode Its state such as position and velocity can be queried and updated A force integration callback can be set to customize the body s physics An area is a region in space which can be used to detect bodies and areas entering and exiting it A body monitoring callback can be set to report entering exiting body shapes and similarly an area monitoring callback can be set Gravity and damping can be overridden within the area by setting area parameters A joint is a constraint either between two bodies or on one body relative to a point Parameters such as the joint bias and the rest length of a spring joint can be adjusted Physics objects in PhysicsServer3D may be created and manipulated independently they do not have to be tied to nodes in the scene tree Note All the 3D physics nodes use the physics server internally Adding a physics node to the scene tree will cause a corresponding physics object to be created in the physics server A rigid body node registers a callback that updates the node s transform with the transform of the respective body object in the physics server every physics update An area node registers a callback to inform the area node about overlaps with the respective area object in the physics server The raycast node queries the direct state of the relevant space in the

to access them Variables stored in project godot are also loaded into ProjectSettings making this object very useful for reading custom game configuration options When naming a Project Settings property use the full path to the setting including the category For example application config name for the project name Category and property names can be viewed in the Project Settings dialog Feature tags Project settings can be overridden for specific platforms and configurations debug release using feature tags Overriding Any project setting can be overridden by creating a file named override cfg in the project s root directory This can also be used in exported projects by placing this file in the same directory as the project binary Overriding will still take the base project settings feature tags in account Therefore make sure to also override the setting with the desired feature tags if you want them to override base project settings on all platforms and configurations

as the boot splash If left empty the default Godot Engine splash will be displayed instead Note Only effective if application boot_splash show_image is true Note The only supported format is PNG Using another image format will result in an error Note The image will also show when opening the project in the editor If you want to display the default splash image in the editor add an empty override for editor_hint feature int application boot_splash minimum_display_time 0 Minimum boot splash display time in milliseconds It is not recommended to set too high values for this setting bool application boot_splash show_image true If true displays the image specified in application boot_splash image when the engine starts If false only displays the plain color specified in application boot_splash bg_color bool application boot_splash use_filter true If true applies linear filtering when scaling the image recommended for high resolution artwork If false uses nearest neighbor interpolation recommended for pixel art bool application config auto_accept_quit true If true the application automatically accepts quitting requests String application config custom_user_dir_name This user directory is used for storing persistent data user filesystem If a custom directory name is defined this name will be appended to the system specific user data directory same parent folder as the Godot configuration folder documented in OS get_user_data_dir The application config use_custom_user_dir setting must be enabled for this to take effect Note If application config custom_user_dir_name contains trailing periods they will be stripped as folder names ending with a period are not allowed on Windows String application config description The project s description displayed as a tooltip in the Project Manager when hovering the project String application config icon Icon used for the project set when project loads Exporters will also use this icon as a fallback if necessary String application config macos_native_icon Icon set in icns format used on macOS to set the game s icon This is done automatically on start by calling DisplayServer set_native_icon String application config name The project s name It is used both by the Project Manager and by exporters The project name can be translated by translating its value in localization files The window title will be set to match the project name automatically on startup Note Changing this value will also change the user data folder s path if application config use_custom_user_dir is false After renaming the project you will no longer be able to access existing data in user unless you rename the old folder to match the new project name See Data paths in the documentation for more information Dictionary application config name_localized Translations of the project s name This setting is used by OS tools to translate application name on Android iOS and macOS String application config project_settings_override Specifies a file to override project settings For example user custom_settings cfg See Overriding in the ProjectSettings class description at the top for more information Note Regardless of this setting s value res override cfg will still be read to override the project settings bool application config quit_on_go_back true If true the application quits automatically when navigating back e g using the system Back button on Android bool application config use_custom_user_dir false If true the project will save user data to its own user directory If application config custom_user_dir_name is empty OS user data directory project name directory will be used If false the project will save user data to OS user data directory Godot app_userdata project name See also File paths in Godot projects This setting is only effective on desktop platforms bool application config use_hidden_project_data_directory true If true the project will use a hidden directory godot for storing project specific data metadata shader cache etc If false a non hidden directory godot will be used instead Note Restart the application after changing this setting Note Changing this value can help on platforms or with third party tools where hidden directory patterns are disallowed Only modify this setting if you know that your environment requires it as changing the default can impact compatibility with some external tools or plugins which expect the default godot folder String application config version The project s human readable version identifier This is used by exporters if the version identifier isn t overridden there If application config version is an empty string and the version identifier isn t overridden in an exporter the exporter will use 1 0 0 as a version identifier String application config windows_native_icon Icon set in ico format used on Windows to set the game s icon This is done automatically on start by calling DisplayServer set_native_icon bool application run delta_smoothing true Time samples for frame deltas are subject to random variation introduced by the platform even when frames are displayed at regular intervals thanks to V Sync This can lead to jitter Delta smoothing can often give a better result by filtering the input deltas to correct for minor fluctuations from the refresh rate Note Delta smoothing is only attempted when display window vsync vsync_mode is set to enabled as it does not work well without V Sync It may take several seconds at a stable frame rate before the smoothing is initially activated It will only be active on machines where performance is adequate to render frames at the refresh rate bool application run disable_stderr false If true disables printing to standard error If true this also hides error and warning messages printed by GlobalScope push_error and GlobalScope push_warning See also application run disable_stdout Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application bool application run disable_stdout false If true disables printing to standard output This is equivalent to starting the editor or project with the quiet command line argument See also application run disable_stderr Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application bool application run enable_alt_space_menu false If true allows the Alt Space keys to display the window menu This menu allows the user to perform various window management operations such as moving resizing or minimizing the window Note When the menu is displayed project execution will pause until the menu is fully closed due to Windows behavior Consider this when enabling this setting in a networked multiplayer game The menu is only considered fully closed when an option is selected when the user clicks outside or when Escape is pressed after bringing up the window menu and another key is pressed afterwards Note This setting is implemented only on Windows bool application run flush_stdout_on_print false If true flushes the standard output stream every time a line is printed This affects both terminal logging and file logging When running a project this setting must be enabled if you want logs to be collected by service managers such as systemd journalctl This setting is disabled by default on release builds since flushing on every printed line will negatively affect performance if lots of lines are printed in a rapid succession Also if this setting is enabled logged files will still be written successfully if the application crashes or is otherwise killed by the user without being closed normally Note Regardless of this setting the standard error stream stderr is always flushed when a line is printed to it Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application bool application run flush_stdout_on_print debug true Debug build override for application run flush_stdout_on_print as performance is less important during debugging Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application int application run frame_delay_msec 0 Forces a constant delay between frames in the main loop in milliseconds In most situations application run max_fps should be preferred as an FPS limiter as it s more precise This setting can be overridden using the frame delay ms command line argument bool application run low_processor_mode false If true enables low processor usage mode When enabled the engine takes longer to redraw but only redraws the screen if necessary This may lower power consumption and is intended for editors or mobile applications For most games because the screen needs to be redrawn every frame it is recommended to keep this setting disabled int application run low_processor_mode_sleep_usec 6900 Amount of sleeping between frames when the low processor usage mode is enabled in microseconds Higher values will result in lower CPU usage String application run main_loop_type SceneTree The name of the type implementing the engine s main loop String application run main_scene Path to the main scene file that will be loaded when the project runs int application run max_fps 0 Maximum number of frames per second allowed A value of 0 means no limit The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project logic and rendering Limiting the FPS can be useful to reduce system power consumption which reduces heat and noise emissions and improves battery life on mobile devices If display window vsync vsync_mode is set to Enabled or Adaptive it takes precedence and the forced FPS number cannot exceed the monitor s refresh rate If display window vsync vsync_mode is Enabled on monitors with variable refresh rate enabled G Sync FreeSync using an FPS limit a few frames lower than the monitor s refresh rate will reduce input lag while avoiding tearing If display window vsync vsync_mode is Disabled limiting the FPS to a high value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag compared to an uncapped framerate Since this works by ensuring the GPU load is lower than 100 this latency reduction is only effective in GPU bottlenecked scenarios not CPU bottlenecked scenarios See also physics common physics_ticks_per_second This setting can be overridden using the max fps fps command line argument including with a value of 0 for unlimited framerate Note This property is only read when the project starts To change the rendering FPS cap at runtime set Engine max_fps instead bool application run print_header true If true the engine header is printed in the console on startup This header describes the current version of the engine as well as the renderer being used This behavior can also be disabled on the command line with the no header option float audio buses channel_disable_threshold_db 60 0 Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing float audio buses channel_disable_time 2 0 Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing String audio buses default_bus_layout res default_bus_layout tres Default AudioBusLayout resource file to use in the project unless overridden by the scene String audio driver driver Specifies the audio driver to use This setting is platform dependent as each platform supports different audio drivers If left empty the default audio driver will be used The Dummy audio driver disables all audio playback and recording which is useful for non game applications as it reduces CPU usage It also prevents the engine from appearing as an application playing audio in the OS audio mixer Note The driver in use can be overridden at runtime via the audio driver command line argument bool audio driver enable_input false If true microphone input will be allowed This requires appropriate permissions to be set when exporting to Android or iOS Note If the operating system blocks access to audio input devices due to the user s privacy settings audio capture will only return silence On Windows 10 and later make sure that apps are allowed to access the microphone in the OS privacy settings int audio driver mix_rate 44100 The mixing rate used for audio in Hz In general it s better to not touch this and leave it to the host operating system int audio driver mix_rate web 0 Safer override for audio driver mix_rate in the Web platform Here 0 means let the browser choose since some browsers do not like forcing the mix rate int audio driver output_latency 15 Specifies the preferred output latency in milliseconds for audio Lower values will result in lower audio latency at the cost of increased CPU usage Low values may result in audible crackling on slower hardware Audio output latency may be constrained by the host operating system and audio hardware drivers If the host can not provide the specified audio output latency then Godot will attempt to use the nearest latency allowed by the host As such you should always use AudioServer get_output_latency to determine the actual audio output latency Audio output latency can be overridden using the audio output latency ms command line argument Note This setting is ignored on Android and on all versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 int audio driver output_latency web 50 Safer override for audio driver output_latency in the Web platform to avoid audio issues especially on mobile devices float audio general 2d_panning_strength 0 5 The base strength of the panning effect for all AudioStreamPlayer2D nodes The panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using AudioStreamPlayer2D panning_strength A value of 0 0 disables stereo panning entirely leaving only volume attenuation in place A value of 1 0 completely mutes one of the channels if the sound is located exactly to the left or right of the listener The default value of 0 5 is tuned for headphones When using speakers you may find lower values to sound better as speakers have a lower stereo separation compared to headphones float audio general 3d_panning_strength 0 5 The base strength of the panning effect for all AudioStreamPlayer3D nodes The panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using AudioStreamPlayer3D panning_strength A value of 0 0 disables stereo panning entirely leaving only volume attenuation in place A value of 1 0 completely mutes one of the channels if the sound is located exactly to the left or right of the listener The default value of 0 5 is tuned for headphones When using speakers you may find lower values to sound better as speakers have a lower stereo separation compared to headphones int audio general default_playback_type 0 Experimental This property may be changed or removed in future versions Specifies the default playback type of the platform The default value is set to Stream as most platforms have no issues mixing streams int audio general default_playback_type web 1 Experimental This property may be changed or removed in future versions Specifies the default playback type of the Web platform The default value is set to Sample as the Web platform is not suited to mix audio streams outside of the Web Audio API especially when exporting a single threaded game Sample allows for lower latency on the web platform at the cost of flexibility AudioEffect s are not supported Warning Forcing Stream on the Web platform may cause high audio latency and crackling especially when exporting a multi threaded game bool audio general ios mix_with_others false Sets the mixWithOthers option for the AVAudioSession on iOS This will override the mix behavior if the category is set to Play and Record Playback or Multi Route Ambient always has this set per default int audio general ios session_category 0 Sets the AVAudioSessionCategory on iOS Use the Playback category to get sound output even if the phone is in silent mode bool audio general text_to_speech false If true text to speech support is enabled see DisplayServer tts_get_voices and DisplayServer tts_speak Note Enabling TTS can cause addition idle CPU usage and interfere with the sleep mode so consider disabling it if TTS is not used int audio video video_delay_compensation_ms 0 Setting to hardcode audio delay when playing video Best to leave this unchanged unless you know what you are doing bool collada use_ambient false If true ambient lights will be imported from COLLADA models as DirectionalLight3D If false ambient lights will be ignored int compression formats

description for this property Please help us by contributing one String display window stretch mode disabled Defines how the base size is stretched to fit the resolution of the window or screen disabled No stretching happens One unit in the scene corresponds to one pixel on the screen In this mode display window stretch aspect has no effect Recommended for non game applications canvas_items The base size specified in width and height in the project settings is stretched to cover the whole screen taking display window stretch aspect into account This means that everything is rendered directly at the target resolution 3D is unaffected while in 2D there is no longer a 1 1 correspondence between sprite pixels and screen pixels which may result in scaling artifacts Recommended for most games that don t use a pixel art aesthetic although it is possible to use this stretch mode for pixel art games too especially in 3D viewport The size of the root Viewport is set precisely to the base size specified in the Project Settings Display section The scene is rendered to this viewport first Finally this viewport is scaled to fit the screen taking display window stretch aspect into account Recommended for games that use a pixel art aesthetic float display window stretch scale 1 0 The scale factor multiplier to use for 2D elements This multiplies the final scale factor determined by display window stretch mode If using the Disabled stretch mode this scale factor is applied as is This can be adjusted to make the UI easier to read on certain displays String display window stretch scale_mode fractional The policy to use to determine the final scale factor for 2D elements This affects how display window stretch scale is applied in addition to the automatic scale factor determined by display window stretch mode fractional The scale factor will not be modified integer The scale factor will be floored to an integer value which means that the screen size will always be an integer multiple of the base viewport size This provides a crisp pixel art appearance Note When using integer scaling with a stretch mode resizing the window to be smaller than the base viewport size will clip the contents Consider preventing that by setting Window min_size to the same value as the base viewport size defined in display window size viewport_width and display window size viewport_height bool display window subwindows embed_subwindows true If true subwindows are embedded in the main window this is also called single window mode Single window mode can be faster as it does not need to create a separate window for every popup and tooltip which can be a slow operation depending on the operating system and rendering method in use If false subwindows are created as separate windows this is also called multi window mode This allows them to be moved outside the main window and use native operating system window decorations This is equivalent to EditorSettings interface editor single_window_mode in the editor except the setting s value is inverted int display window vsync vsync_mode 1 Sets the V Sync mode for the main game window The editor s own V Sync mode can be set using EditorSettings interface editor vsync_mode See VSyncMode for possible values and how they affect the behavior of your application Depending on the platform and rendering method the engine will fall back to Enabled if the desired mode is not supported V Sync can be disabled on the command line using the disable vsync command line argument Note The Adaptive and Mailbox V Sync

Keep in mind that the Godot project is considered one of the C projects in the workspace and it s root directory should contain the project godot and csproj next to each other bool editor export convert_text_resources_to_binary true If true text resource tres and text scene tscn files are converted to their corresponding binary format on export This decreases file sizes and speeds up loading slightly Note Because a resource s file extension may change in an exported project it is heavily recommended to use GDScript load or ResourceLoader instead of FileAccess to load resources dynamically Note The project settings file project godot will always be converted to binary on export regardless of this setting int editor import atlas_max_width 2048 The maximum width to use when importing

can speed up video writing if the hardware is fast enough to render encode and save the video at a framerate higher than the monitor s refresh rate Note editor movie_writer disable_vsync has no effect if the operating system or graphics driver forces V Sync with no way for applications to disable it int editor movie_writer fps 60 The number of frames per second to record in the video when writing a movie Simulation speed will adjust to always match the specified framerate which means the engine will appear to run slower at higher editor movie_writer fps values Certain FPS values will require you to adjust editor movie_writer mix_rate to prevent audio from desynchronizing over time This can be specified manually on the command line using the fixed fps fps command line argument int editor movie_writer mix_rate 48000 The audio mix rate to use in the recorded audio when writing a movie in Hz This can be different from audio driver mix_rate but this value must be divisible by editor movie_writer fps to prevent audio from desynchronizing over time float editor movie_writer mjpeg_quality 0 75 The JPEG quality to use when writing a video to an AVI file between 0 01 and 1 0 inclusive Higher quality values result in better looking output at the cost of larger file sizes Recommended quality values are between 0 75 and 0 9 Even at quality 1 0 JPEG compression remains lossy Note This

Godot has 2 built in MovieWriter s AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio avi file extension Lossy compression medium file sizes fast encoding The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing editor movie_writer mjpeg_quality The resulting file can be viewed in most video players but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with VideoStreamPlayer MJPEG does not support transparency AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in size at most PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio png file extension Lossless compression large file sizes slow encoding Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as FFmpeg after recording Transparency is currently not supported even if the root viewport is set to be transparent If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third party software you can extend this MovieWriter class to create your own movie writers When using PNG output the frame number will be appended at the end of the file name It starts from 0 and is padded with 8 digits to ensure correct sorting and easier processing For example if the output path is tmp

many other helper objects inherit this class Unlike other Object types RefCounted s keep an internal reference counter so that they are automatically released when no longer in use and only then RefCounted s therefore do not need to be freed manually with Object free RefCounted instances caught in a cyclic reference will not be freed automatically For example if a node holds a reference to instance A which directly or indirectly holds a reference back to A A s reference count will be 2 Destruction of the node will leave A dangling with a reference count of 1 and there will be a memory leak To prevent this one of the references in the cycle can be made weak with GlobalScope weakref In the vast majority of use cases instantiating and using RefCounted derived types is all you need to do The methods provided in this class are only for advanced users and can cause issues if misused Note In C reference counted objects will not be freed instantly after they are no longer in use Instead garbage collection will run periodically and will free reference counted objects that are no longer in use This means that unused ones will remain in memory for a while before being removed

Class for searching text for patterns using regular expressions Description A regular expression or regex is a compact language that can be used to recognize strings that follow a specific pattern such as URLs email addresses complete sentences etc For example a regex of ab 0 9 would find any string that is ab followed by any number from 0 to 9 For a more in depth look you can easily find various tutorials and detailed explanations on the Internet To begin the RegEx object needs to be compiled with the search pattern using compile before it can be used var regex RegEx new regex compile w d Copy to clipboard The search pattern must be escaped first for GDScript before it is escaped for the expression For example compile d would be read by RegEx as d Similarly compile would be read as In GDScript you can also use raw string literals r strings For example compile r would be read the same Using search you can find the pattern within the given text If a pattern is found RegExMatch is returned and you can retrieve details of the results using methods such as RegExMatch get_string and RegExMatch get_start var regex RegEx new regex compile w d var result regex search abc n 0123 if result print result get_string Would print n 0123 Copy to clipboard The results of capturing groups can be retrieved by passing the group number to the various methods in RegExMatch Group 0 is the default and will always refer to the entire pattern In the above example calling result get_string 1 would give you 0123 This version of RegEx also supports named capturing groups and the names can be used to retrieve the results If two or more groups have the same name the name would only refer to the first one with a match var regex RegEx new regex compile d digit 0 9 x digit 0 9a f var result regex search the number is x2f if result print result get_string digit Would print 2f Copy to clipboard If you need to process multiple results search_all generates a list of all non overlapping results This can be combined with a for loop for convenience for result in regex search_all d01 d03 d0c x3f and x42 print result get_string digit Would print 01 03 0 3f 42 Copy to clipboard Example of splitting a string using a RegEx var regex RegEx new regex compile S Negated whitespace character class var results for result in regex search_all One Two n t Three results push_back result get_string

when searching for another match in the same subject by calling this method again after a previous success Note that setting these parameters differs from passing over a shortened string For example the start anchor is not affected by offset and the character before offset will be checked for the word boundary b Array RegExMatch search_all subject String offset int 0 end int 1 const Searches the

RenderingDevice is an abstraction for working with modern low level graphics APIs such as Vulkan Compared to RenderingServer which works with Godot s own rendering subsystems RenderingDevice is much lower level and allows working more directly with the underlying graphics APIs RenderingDevice is used in Godot to provide support for several modern low level graphics APIs while reducing the amount of code duplication required RenderingDevice can also be used in your own projects to perform things that are not exposed by RenderingServer or high level nodes such as using compute shaders On startup Godot creates a global RenderingDevice which can be retrieved using RenderingServer get_rendering_device This global RenderingDevice performs drawing to the screen Local RenderingDevices Using RenderingServer create_local_rendering_device you can create secondary rendering devices to perform drawing and GPU compute operations on separate threads Note RenderingDevice assumes intermediate knowledge of modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan Direct3D 12 Metal or WebGPU These graphics APIs are lower level than OpenGL or Direct3D 11 requiring you to perform what was previously done by the graphics driver itself If you have difficulty understanding the concepts used in this class follow the Vulkan Tutorial or Vulkan Guide It s recommended to have existing modern OpenGL or Direct3D 11 knowledge before attempting to learn a low level graphics API Note RenderingDevice is not available when running in headless mode or when using the Compatibility rendering method Tutorials Using

everything visible The whole scene system mounts on it to display The rendering server is completely opaque the internals are entirely implementation specific and cannot be accessed The rendering server can be used to bypass the scene Node system entirely This can improve performance in cases where the scene system is the bottleneck but won t improve performance otherwise for instance if the GPU is already fully utilized Resources are created using the _create functions These functions return RID s which are not references to the objects themselves but opaque pointers towards these objects All objects are drawn to a viewport You can use the Viewport attached to the SceneTree or you can create one yourself with viewport_create When using a custom scenario or canvas the scenario or canvas needs to be attached to the viewport using viewport_set_scenario or viewport_attach_canvas Scenarios In 3D all visual objects must be associated with a scenario The scenario is a visual representation of the world If accessing the rendering server from a running game the scenario can be accessed from the scene tree from any Node3D node with Node3D get_world_3d Otherwise a scenario can be created with scenario_create Similarly in 2D a canvas is needed to draw all canvas items 3D In 3D all visible objects are comprised of a resource and an instance A resource can be a mesh a particle system a light or any other 3D object In order to be visible resources must be attached to an instance using instance_set_base The instance must also be attached to the scenario using instance_set_scenario in order to be visible RenderingServer methods that don t have a prefix are usually 3D specific but not always 2D In 2D all visible objects are some form of canvas item In order to be visible a canvas item needs to be the child of a canvas attached to a viewport or it needs to be the child of another canvas item that is eventually attached to the canvas 2D specific

nearest power of 2 If use_16_bits is true use 16 bits for the omni spot shadow depth map Enabling this results in shadows having less precision and may result in shadow acne but can lead to performance improvements on some devices Note If this is set to 0 no positional shadows will be visible at all This can improve performance significantly on low end systems by reducing both the CPU and GPU load as fewer draw calls are needed to draw the scene without shadows void viewport_set_render_direct_to_screen viewport RID enabled bool If true render the contents of the viewport directly to screen This allows a low level optimization where you can skip drawing a viewport to the root viewport While this optimization can result in a significant increase in speed especially on older devices it comes at a cost of usability When this is enabled you cannot read from the viewport or from the screen_texture You also lose the benefit of certain window settings such as the various stretch modes Another consequence to be aware of is that in 2D the rendering happens in window coordinates so if you have a viewport that is double the size of the window and you set this then only the portion that fits within the window will be drawn no automatic scaling is possible even if your game scene is significantly larger than the window size void viewport_set_scaling_3d_mode viewport RID scaling_3d_mode ViewportScaling3DMode Sets the 3D resolution scaling mode Bilinear scaling renders at different resolution to either undersample or supersample the viewport FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 0 abbreviated to FSR is an upscaling technology that produces high quality images at fast framerates by using a spatially aware upscaling algorithm FSR is slightly more expensive than bilinear but it produces significantly higher image quality FSR should be used where possible void viewport_set_scaling_3d_scale viewport RID scale float Scales the 3D render buffer based on the viewport size uses an image filter specified in ViewportScaling3DMode to scale the output image to the full viewport size Values lower than 1 0 can be used to speed up 3D rendering at the cost of quality undersampling Values greater than 1 0 are only valid for bilinear mode and can be used to improve 3D rendering quality at a high performance cost supersampling See also ViewportMSAA for multi sample antialiasing which is significantly cheaper but only smoothens the edges of polygons When using FSR upscaling AMD recommends exposing the following values as preset options to users Ultra Quality 0 77 Quality 0 67 Balanced 0 59 Performance 0 5 instead of exposing the entire scale void viewport_set_scenario viewport RID scenario RID Sets a viewport s scenario The scenario contains

viewport_set_size viewport RID width int height int Sets the viewport s width and height in pixels void viewport_set_snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel viewport RID enabled bool If true canvas item transforms i e origin position are snapped to the nearest pixel when rendering This can lead to a crisper appearance at the cost of less smooth movement especially when Camera2D smoothing is enabled Equivalent to ProjectSettings rendering 2d snap snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel void viewport_set_snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel viewport RID enabled bool If true canvas item vertices i e polygon points are snapped to the nearest pixel when rendering This can lead to a crisper appearance at the cost of less smooth movement especially when Camera2D smoothing is enabled Equivalent to ProjectSettings rendering 2d snap snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel void viewport_set_texture_mipmap_bias viewport RID mipmap_bias float Affects the final texture sharpness by reading from a lower or higher mipmap also called texture LOD bias Negative values make mipmapped textures sharper but grainier when viewed at a distance while positive values make mipmapped textures blurrier even when up close To get sharper textures at a distance without introducing too much graininess set this between 0 75 and 0 0 Enabling temporal antialiasing ProjectSettings rendering anti_aliasing quality use_taa can help reduce the graininess visible when using negative mipmap bias Note When the 3D scaling mode is set to FSR 1 0 this value is used to adjust the automatic mipmap bias which is calculated internally based on the scale factor The formula for this is log2 1 0 scale mipmap_bias void viewport_set_transparent_background viewport RID enabled bool If true the viewport renders its background as transparent void viewport_set_update_mode viewport RID update_mode ViewportUpdateMode Sets when the viewport should be updated See ViewportUpdateMode constants for options void viewport_set_use_debanding viewport RID enable bool If true enables debanding on the specified viewport Equivalent to ProjectSettings rendering anti_aliasing quality use_debanding void viewport_set_use_hdr_2d viewport RID enabled bool If true 2D rendering will use a high dynamic range HDR format framebuffer matching the bit depth of the 3D framebuffer When using the Forward renderer this will be an RGBA16 framebuffer while when using the Mobile renderer it will be an RGB10_A2 framebuffer Additionally 2D rendering will take place in linear color space and will be converted to sRGB space immediately before blitting to the screen if the Viewport is attached to the screen Practically speaking this means that the end result of the Viewport will not be clamped into the 0 1 range and can be used in 3D rendering without color space adjustments This allows 2D rendering to take advantage of effects requiring high dynamic range e g 2D glow as well as substantially improves the appearance of effects requiring highly detailed gradients This setting has the same effect as Viewport use_hdr_2d Note This setting will have no effect when using the GL Compatibility renderer as the GL Compatibility renderer always renders in low dynamic range for performance reasons void viewport_set_use_occlusion_culling viewport RID enable bool If true enables occlusion culling on the specified viewport Equivalent to ProjectSettings

ResourceImporterDynamicFont Inherits ResourceImporter RefCounted Object Imports a TTF TTC OTF OTC WOFF or WOFF2 font file for font rendering that adapts to any size Description Unlike bitmap fonts dynamic fonts can be resized to any size and still look crisp Dynamic fonts also optionally support MSDF font rendering which allows for run time scale changes with no re rasterization cost While WOFF and especially WOFF2 tend to result in smaller file sizes there is no universally better font format In most situations it s recommended to use the font format that was shipped on the font developer s

allow_system_fallback true If true automatically use system fonts as a fallback if a glyph isn t found in this dynamic font This makes supporting CJK characters or emoji more straightforward as you don t need to include a CJK emoji font in your project See also fallbacks Note The appearance of system fonts varies across platforms Loading system fonts is only supported on Windows macOS Linux Android and iOS int antialiasing 1 The font antialiasing method to use Disabled Most suited for pixel art fonts although you do not have to change the antialiasing from the default Grayscale if the font file was well created and the font is used at an integer multiple of its intended size If pixel art fonts have a bad appearance at their intended size try setting subpixel_positioning to Disabled instead Grayscale Use grayscale antialiasing This is the approach used by the operating system on macOS Android and iOS LCD Subpixel Use antialiasing with subpixel patterns to make fonts sharper on LCD displays This is the approach used by the operating system on Windows and most Linux distributions The downside is that this can introduce fringing on edges especially on display technologies that don t use standard RGB subpixels such as OLED displays The LCD subpixel layout is globally controlled by ProjectSettings gui theme lcd_subpixel_layout which also allows falling back to grayscale antialiasing bool compress true If true uses lossless compression for the resulting font bool disable_embedded_bitmaps true If set to true embedded font bitmap loading is disabled bitmap only and color fonts ignore this property Array fallbacks List of font fallbacks to use if a glyph isn t found in this dynamic font Fonts at the beginning of the array are attempted first but fallback fonts that don t support the glyph s language and script are attempted last see language_support and script_support See also allow_system_fallback bool force_autohinter false If true forces generation of hinting data for the font using FreeType s autohinter This will make hinting effective with fonts that don t include hinting data bool generate_mipmaps false If true this font will have mipmaps generated This prevents text from looking grainy when a Control is scaled down or when a Label3D is viewed from a long distance if Label3D texture_filter is set to a mode that displays mipmaps Enabling generate_mipmaps increases font generation time and memory usage Only enable this setting if you actually need it int hinting 1 The hinting mode to use This controls how aggressively glyph edges should be snapped to pixels when rasterizing the font Depending on personal preference you may prefer using one hinting mode over the other Hinting modes other than None are only effective if the font contains hinting data see force_autohinter None Smoothest appearance which can make the font look blurry at small sizes Light Sharp result by snapping glyph edges to pixels on the Y axis only Full Sharpest by snapping glyph edges to pixels on both X and Y axes Dictionary language_support Override the list of languages supported by this font If left empty this is supplied by the font metadata There is usually no need to change this See also script_support int msdf_pixel_range 8 The width of the range around the shape between the minimum and maximum representable signed distance If using font outlines msdf_pixel_range must be set to at least twice the size of the largest font outline The default msdf_pixel_range value of 8 allows outline sizes up to 4 to look correct int msdf_size 48 Source font size used to generate MSDF textures Higher values allow for more precision but are slower to render and require more memory Only increase this value if you notice a visible lack of precision in glyph rendering Only effective if multichannel_signed_distance_field is true bool multichannel_signed_distance_field false If set to true the default font will use multichannel signed distance field MSDF for crisp rendering at any size Since this approach does not rely on rasterizing the font every time its size changes this allows for resizing the font in real time without any performance penalty Text will also not look grainy for Control s that are scaled down or for Label3D s viewed from a long distance MSDF font rendering can be combined with generate_mipmaps to further improve font rendering quality when scaled down Dictionary opentype_features The OpenType features to enable disable or set a value for this font This can be used to enable optional features provided by the font such as ligatures or alternative glyphs The list of supported OpenType features varies on a per font basis float oversampling 0 0 If set to a value greater than 0 0 overrides the oversampling factor for the font This can be used to render the font at a higher or lower resolution than intended without affecting its physical size In most cases this should be left at 0 0 Array preload The glyph ranges to prerender This can avoid stuttering during gameplay when new characters need to be rendered especially if subpixel_positioning is enabled The downside of using preloading is that initial project load times will increase as well as memory usage Dictionary script_support Override the list of language scripts supported by this font If left empty this is supplied by the font metadata There is usually no need to change this See also language_support int subpixel_positioning 1 Subpixel positioning improves font rendering appearance especially at smaller font sizes The downside is that it takes more time to initially render the font which can cause stuttering during gameplay especially if used with large font sizes This should be set to Disabled for fonts with a pixel art appearance Disabled No subpixel positioning Lowest quality fastest rendering Auto Use subpixel positioning at small font sizes the chosen quality varies depending on font size Large fonts will not use subpixel positioning This is a good tradeoff between performance and quality One Half of a Pixel Always perform intermediate subpixel positioning regardless of font size High quality slow rendering One Quarter of a Pixel Always perform precise subpixel positioning regardless of font size Highest quality slowest rendering User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes

appears incorrect try adjusting character_margin PackedStringArray character_ranges PackedStringArray The character ranges to import from the font image This is an array that maps each position on the image in tile coordinates not pixels The font atlas is traversed from left to right and top to bottom Characters can be specified with decimal numbers 127 hexadecimal numbers 0x007f or U 007f or between single quotes Ranges can be specified with a hyphen between characters For example 0 127 represents the full ASCII range It can also be written as 0x0000 0x007f or U 0000 U 007f As another example is equivalent to 32 127 and represents the range of printable visible ASCII characters For any range the character advance and offset can be customized by appending three space separated integer values additional advance x offset y offset to the end For example a b 4 5 2 sets the advance to char_width 4 and offset to Vector2 5 2 for both a and b characters Make sure character_ranges

channel_pack 0 Controls how color channels should be used in the imported texture sRGB Friendly prevents the RG color format from being used as it does not support sRGB color Optimized allows the RG color format to be used if the texture does not use the blue channel This reduces memory usage if the texture s blue channel can be discarded all pixels must have a blue value of 0 Normal Map RG Channels This forces all layers from the texture to be imported with the RG color format to reduce memory usage with only the red and green channels preserved This only has an effect on textures with

VRAM compression should be performed for HDR images Disabled Never use VRAM compression for HDR textures regardless of whether they re opaque or transparent Instead the texture is converted to RGBE9995 9 bits per channel 5 bit exponent 32 bits per pixel to reduce memory usage compared to a half float or single precision float image format Opaque Only Only uses VRAM compression for opaque HDR textures This is due to a limitation of HDR formats as there is no VRAM compressed HDR format that supports transparency at the same time Always Force VRAM compression even for HDR textures with an alpha channel To perform this the alpha channel is discarded on import Note Only effective on Radiance HDR hdr and OpenEXR exr images bool compress high_quality false If true uses BPTC compression on desktop platforms and ASTC compression on mobile platforms When using BPTC BC7 is used for SDR textures and BC6H is used for HDR textures If false uses the faster but lower quality S3TC compression on desktop platforms and ETC2 on mobile web platforms When using S3TC DXT1 BC1 is used for opaque textures and DXT5 BC3 is used for transparent or normal map RGTC textures BPTC and ASTC support VRAM

disk fastest import Basis Universal Reduced quality low memory usage lowest size on disk slow import Only use for textures in 3D scenes not for 2D elements See Compress mode in the manual for more details bool mipmaps generate true If true smaller versions of the texture are generated on import For example a 64 64 texture will generate 6 mipmaps 32 32 16 16 8 8 4 4 2 2 1 1 This has several benefits Textures will not become grainy in the distance in 3D or if scaled down due to Camera2D zoom or CanvasItem scale in 2D Performance will improve if the texture is displayed in the distance since sampling smaller versions of the original texture is faster and requires less memory bandwidth The downside of mipmaps is that they increase memory usage by roughly 33 for Texture2DArray Cubemap and CubemapArray or 14 for Texture3D It s recommended to enable mipmaps in 3D However in 2D this should only be enabled if your project visibly benefits from having mipmaps enabled If the camera never zooms out significantly there won t be a benefit to enabling mipmaps but memory usage will increase int mipmaps limit 1 Unimplemented This currently has no effect when changed int slices arrangement 1

painted and uses some internal numbering often imported from 3D modeling software The skin contains the information necessary to bind this mesh onto this Skeleton3D For every one of the internal bone IDs chosen by the 3D modeling software it contains two things Firstly a matrix known as the Bind Pose Matrix Inverse Bind Matrix or IBM for short Secondly the Skin contains each bone s name if skins use_named_skins is true or the bone s index within the Skeleton3D list if skins use_named_skins is false Together this information is enough to tell Godot how to use the bone poses in the Skeleton3D node to render the mesh from each MeshInstance3D Note that each MeshInstance3D may share binds as is common in models exported from Blender or each MeshInstance3D may use a separate Skin object as is

ASTC support VRAM compression for HDR textures but S3TC and ETC2 do not see compress hdr_compression float compress lossy_quality 0 7 The quality to use when using the Lossy compression mode Higher values result in better quality at the cost of larger file sizes Lossy quality does not affect memory usage of the imported texture only its file size on disk int compress mode 0 The compression mode to use Each compression mode provides a different tradeoff Lossless Original quality high memory usage high size on disk fast import Lossy Reduced quality high memory usage low size on disk fast import VRAM Compressed Reduced quality low memory usage low size on disk slowest import Only use for textures in 3D scenes not for 2D elements VRAM Uncompressed Original quality high memory usage highest size on disk fastest import Basis Universal Reduced quality low memory usage lowest size on disk slow import Only use for textures in 3D scenes not for 2D elements See Compress mode in the manual for more details int compress normal_map 0 When using a texture as normal map only the red and green channels are required Given regular texture compression algorithms produce artifacts that don t look that nice in normal maps the RGTC compression format is the best fit for this data Forcing this option to Enable will make Godot import the image as RGTC compressed By default it s set to Detect This means that if the texture is ever detected to be used as a normal map it will be changed to Enable and reimported automatically Note that RGTC compression affects the resulting normal map image You will have to adjust custom shaders that use the normal map s blue channel to take this into account Built in material shaders already ignore the blue channel in a normal map regardless of the actual normal map s contents int detect_3d compress_to 1 This changes the compress mode option that is used when a texture is detected as being used in 3D Changing this import option only has an effect if a texture is detected as being used in 3D Changing this to Disabled then reimporting will not change the existing compress mode on a texture if it s detected to be used in 3D but choosing VRAM Compressed or Basis Universal will bool editor convert_colors_with_editor_theme false If true converts the imported image s colors to match EditorSettings interface theme icon_and_font_color This assumes the image uses the exact same colors as Godot s own color palette for editor icons with the source file designed for a dark editor theme This should be enabled for editor plugin icons and custom class icons but should be left disabled otherwise Note Only available for SVG images bool editor scale_with_editor_scale false If true scales the imported image to match EditorSettings interface editor custom_display_scale This should be enabled for editor plugin icons and custom class icons but should be left disabled otherwise Note Only available for SVG images bool mipmaps generate false If true smaller versions of the texture are generated on import For example a 64 64 texture will generate 6 mipmaps 32 32 16 16 8 8 4 4 2 2 1 1 This has several benefits Textures will not become grainy in the distance in 3D or if scaled down due to Camera2D zoom or CanvasItem scale in 2D Performance will improve if the texture is displayed in the distance since sampling smaller versions of the original texture is faster and requires less memory bandwidth The downside of mipmaps is that they increase memory usage by roughly 33 It s recommended to enable mipmaps in 3D However in 2D this should only be enabled if your project visibly benefits from having mipmaps enabled If the camera never zooms out significantly there won t be a benefit to enabling mipmaps but memory usage will increase int mipmaps limit 1 Unimplemented This currently has no effect when changed bool process fix_alpha_border true If true puts pixels of the same surrounding color in transition from transparent to opaque areas For textures displayed with bilinear filtering this helps to reduce the outline effect when exporting images from an image editor It s recommended to leave this enabled as it is by default unless this causes issues for a particular image bool process hdr_as_srgb false Some HDR images you can find online may be broken and contain sRGB color data instead of linear color data It is advised not to use those files If you absolutely have to enabling process hdr_as_srgb will make them look correct Warning Enabling process hdr_as_srgb on well formatted HDR images will cause the resulting image to look too dark so leave this on false if unsure bool process hdr_clamp_exposure false If true clamps exposure in the imported high dynamic range images using a smart clamping formula without introducing visible clipping Some HDR panorama images you can find online may contain extremely bright pixels due to being taken from real life sources without any clipping While these HDR panorama images are accurate to real life this can cause the radiance map generated by Godot to contain sparkles when used as a background sky This can be seen in material reflections even on rough materials in extreme cases Enabling process hdr_clamp_exposure can resolve this bool process normal_map_invert_y false If true convert the normal map from Y DirectX style to Y OpenGL style by inverting its green color channel This is the normal map convention expected by Godot More information about normal maps including a coordinate order table for popular engines can be found here bool process premult_alpha false An alternative to fixing darkened borders with process fix_alpha_border is to use premultiplied alpha By enabling this option the texture will be converted to this format A premultiplied alpha texture requires specific materials to be displayed correctly In 2D a CanvasItemMaterial will need to be created and configured to use the CanvasItemMaterial BLEND_MODE_PREMULT_ALPHA blend mode on CanvasItem s that use this texture In custom canvas_item shaders render_mode blend_premul_alpha should be used In 3D a BaseMaterial3D will need to be created and configured to use the BaseMaterial3D BLEND_MODE_PREMULT_ALPHA blend mode on materials that use this texture In custom spatial shaders render_mode blend_premul_alpha should be used int process size_limit 0 If set to a value greater than 0 the size of the texture is limited on import to a value smaller than or equal to the value specified here For non square textures the size limit affects the longer dimension with the shorter dimension scaled to preserve aspect ratio Resizing is performed using cubic interpolation This can be used to reduce memory usage without affecting the source images or avoid issues with textures not displaying on mobile web platforms as these usually can t display textures larger than 4096 4096 int roughness mode 0 The color channel to consider as a roughness map in this texture Only effective if Roughness Src Normal is not empty String roughness src_normal The path to the texture to consider as a normal map for roughness filtering on import Specifying this can help decrease specular aliasing slightly in 3D Roughness filtering on import is only used in 3D rendering not 2D float svg scale 1 0 The scale the SVG should be rendered at with 1

Descriptions String atlas_file Path to the atlas spritesheet This must be set to valid path to a PNG image Otherwise the atlas will fail to import bool crop_to_region false If true discards empty areas from the atlas This only affects final sprite positioning not storage See also trim_alpha_border_from_region Note Only effective if import_mode is Region int import_mode 0 Region Imports the atlas in an AtlasTexture resource which is rendered as a rectangle This is fast to render but transparent areas still have to be rendered if they can t be trimmed effectively by trim_alpha_border_from_region This can reduce performance when rendering large sprites on screen Mesh Imports the atlas as an ArrayMesh resource keeping the original bitmap visible but rendered as a polygon This can be used to reduce fill rate when rendering large transparent sprites at the cost of slower rendering if there are little to no transparent areas in the sprite bool trim_alpha_border_from_region true If true trims the region to exclude fully transparent pixels using a clipping rectangle which is never rotated This can be used to save memory See also

Forward Ping Pong or Backward This is set in samples after the beginning of the audio file A value of 1 uses the end of the audio file as the end loop point int edit loop_mode 0 Controls how audio should loop This is automatically read from the WAV metadata on import Disabled Don t loop audio even if metadata indicates the file should be played back looping Forward Standard audio looping Ping Pong Play audio forward until it s done playing then play it backward and repeat This is similar to mirrored texture repeat but for audio Backward Play audio in reverse and loop back to the end when done playing Note In AudioStreamPlayer the AudioStreamPlayer finished signal won t be emitted for looping audio when it reaches the end of the audio file as the audio will keep playing indefinitely bool edit normalize false If true normalize the audio volume so that its peak volume is equal to 0 dB When enabled normalization will make audio sound louder depending on its original peak volume bool edit trim false If true automatically trim the beginning and end of the audio if it s lower than 50 dB after normalization see edit normalize This prevents having files with silence at the beginning or end which increases their size unnecessarily and adds latency to the moment they are played back A fade in fade out period of 500 samples is also used during trimming to avoid audible pops bool force 8_bit false If true forces the imported audio to use 8 bit quantization if the source file is 16 bit or higher Enabling this is generally not recommended as 8 bit quantization decreases audio quality significantly If you need smaller file sizes consider using Ogg Vorbis or MP3 audio instead bool force max_rate false If set to a value greater than 0 forces the audio s sample rate to be reduced to a value lower than or equal to the value specified in force max_rate_hz This can decrease file size noticeably on certain sounds without impacting quality depending on the actual sound s contents See Best practices for more information float force max_rate_hz 44100 The frequency to limit the imported audio sample to in Hz Only effective if force max_rate is true bool force mono false

of nodes in a scene as well as scenes themselves Nodes can be added fetched and removed The whole scene tree and thus the current scene can be paused Scenes can be loaded switched and reloaded You can also use the SceneTree to organize your nodes into groups every node can be added to as many groups as you want to create e g an enemy group You can then iterate these groups or even call methods and set properties on all the nodes belonging to any given group SceneTree is the default MainLoop implementation used by the engine and is thus in charge of the game loop Tutorials SceneTree Multiple

child of root Note This property does nothing in release builds bool multiplayer_poll true void set_multiplayer_poll_enabled value bool bool is_multiplayer_poll_enabled If true default value enables automatic polling of the MultiplayerAPI for this SceneTree during process_frame If false you need to manually call MultiplayerAPI poll to process network packets and deliver RPCs This allows running

node Children of the root node may include the loaded current_scene as well as any AutoLoad configured in the Project Settings Warning Do not delete this node This will result in unstable behavior followed by a crash Method Descriptions void call_group group StringName method StringName vararg Calls method on each node inside this tree added to the given group You can pass arguments to method by specifying them at the end of this method call Nodes that cannot call method either because the method doesn t exist or the arguments do not match are ignored See also set_group and notify_group Note This method acts immediately on all selected nodes at once which may cause stuttering in some performance intensive situations Note In C method must be in snake_case when referring to built in Godot methods Prefer using the names exposed in the MethodName class to avoid allocating a new StringName on each call void call_group_flags flags int group StringName method StringName vararg Calls the given method on each node inside this tree added to the given group Use flags to customize this method s behavior see GroupCallFlags Additional arguments for method can be passed at the end of this method Nodes that cannot call method either because the method doesn t exist or the arguments do not match are ignored Calls hide to all nodes of the enemies group at the end of the frame and in reverse tree order get_tree call_group_flags SceneTree GROUP_CALL_DEFERRED SceneTree GROUP_CALL_REVERSE enemies hide Copy to clipboard Note In C method must be in snake_case when referring to built in Godot methods Prefer using the names exposed in the MethodName class to avoid allocating a new StringName on each call Error change_scene_to_file path String Changes the running scene to the one at the given path after loading it into a PackedScene and creating a new instance Returns GlobalScope OK on success GlobalScope ERR_CANT_OPEN if the path cannot be loaded into a PackedScene or GlobalScope ERR_CANT_CREATE if that scene cannot be instantiated Note See change_scene_to_packed for details on the order of operations Error change_scene_to_packed packed_scene PackedScene Changes the running scene to a new instance of the given PackedScene which must be valid Returns GlobalScope OK on success GlobalScope ERR_CANT_CREATE if the scene cannot be instantiated or GlobalScope ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER if the scene is invalid Note Operations happen in the following order when change_scene_to_packed is called The current scene node is immediately removed from the tree From that point Node get_tree called on the current outgoing scene will return null current_scene will be null too because the new scene is not available yet At the end of the frame the formerly current scene already removed from the tree will be deleted freed from memory and then the new scene will be instantiated and added to the tree Node get_tree and current_scene will be back to working as usual This ensures that both scenes aren t running at the same time while still freeing the previous scene in a safe way similar to Node queue_free SceneTreeTimer create_timer time_sec float process_always bool true process_in_physics bool false ignore_time_scale bool false Returns a new SceneTreeTimer After time_sec in seconds have passed the timer will emit SceneTreeTimer timeout and will be automatically freed If process_always is false the timer will be paused when setting paused to true If process_in_physics is true the timer will update at the end of the physics frame instead of the process frame If ignore_time_scale is true the timer will ignore Engine time_scale and update with the real elapsed time This method is commonly used to create a one shot delay timer as in the following example GDScript C func some_function print start await get_tree create_timer 1 0 timeout print end Copy to clipboard public async Task SomeFunction GD Print start await ToSignal GetTree CreateTimer 1 0f SceneTreeTimer SignalName Timeout GD Print end Copy to clipboard Note The timer is always updated after all of the nodes in the tree A node s Node _process method would be called before the timer updates or Node _physics_process if process_in_physics is set to true Tween create_tween Creates and returns a new Tween processed in this tree The Tween will start automatically on the next process frame or physics frame depending on its TweenProcessMode Note A Tween created using this method is not bound to any Node It may keep working until there is nothing left to animate If you want the Tween to be automatically killed when the Node is freed use Node create_tween or Tween bind_node Node get_first_node_in_group group StringName Returns the first Node found inside the tree that has been added to the given group in scene hierarchy order Returns null if no match is found See also get_nodes_in_group int get_frame const Returns how many frames have been processed since the application started This is not a measurement of elapsed time MultiplayerAPI get_multiplayer for_path NodePath NodePath const Searches for the MultiplayerAPI configured for the given path if one does not exist it searches the parent paths until one is found If the path is empty or none is found the default one is returned See set_multiplayer int get_node_count const Returns the number of nodes inside this tree int get_node_count_in_group group StringName const Returns the number of nodes assigned to the given group Array Node get_nodes_in_group group StringName Returns an Array containing all nodes inside this tree that have been added to the given group in scene hierarchy order Array Tween get_processed_tweens Returns an Array of currently existing Tween s in the tree including paused tweens bool has_group name StringName const Returns true if a node added to the given group name exists in the tree void notify_group group StringName notification int Calls Object notification with the given notification to all nodes inside this tree added to the group See also Godot notifications and call_group and set_group Note This method acts immediately on all selected nodes at once which may cause stuttering in some performance intensive situations void notify_group_flags call_flags int group StringName notification int Calls Object notification with the given notification to all nodes inside this tree added to the group Use call_flags to customize this method s behavior see GroupCallFlags void queue_delete obj Object Queues the given obj to be deleted calling its Object free at the end of the current frame This method is similar to Node queue_free void quit exit_code int 0 Quits the application at the end of the current iteration with the given exit_code By convention an exit code of 0 indicates success whereas any other exit code indicates an error For portability reasons it should be between 0 and 125 inclusive Note On iOS this method doesn t work Instead as recommended by the iOS Human Interface Guidelines the user is expected to close apps via the Home button Error reload_current_scene Reloads the currently active scene replacing current_scene with a new instance of its original PackedScene Returns GlobalScope OK on success GlobalScope ERR_UNCONFIGURED if no current_scene is defined GlobalScope ERR_CANT_OPEN if current_scene cannot be loaded into a PackedScene or GlobalScope ERR_CANT_CREATE if the scene cannot be instantiated void set_group group StringName property String value Variant Sets the given property to value on all nodes inside this tree added to the given group Nodes that do not have the property are ignored See also call_group and notify_group Note This method acts immediately on all selected nodes at once which may cause stuttering in some performance intensive situations Note In C property must be in snake_case when referring to built in Godot properties Prefer using the names exposed in the PropertyName class to avoid allocating a new StringName on each call void set_group_flags call_flags int group StringName property String value Variant Sets the given property to value on all nodes inside this tree added to the given group Nodes that do not have the property are ignored Use call_flags to customize this method s behavior see GroupCallFlags Note In C property must be in snake_case when referring to built in Godot properties Prefer using the names exposed in the PropertyName class to avoid allocating a new StringName on each call void set_multiplayer multiplayer MultiplayerAPI root_path NodePath NodePath Sets a custom MultiplayerAPI with the given root_path controlling also the relative subpaths or override the default one if root_path is empty Note No MultiplayerAPI must be configured for the subpath containing root_path nested custom multiplayers are not allowed I e if one is configured for root Foo setting one for root Foo Bar will cause an error void unload_current_scene If a current scene is loaded calling this method will unload it User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before submitting a comment Up to date This page is up to date for Godot

Description A synchronization semaphore that can be used to synchronize multiple Thread s Initialized to zero on creation For a binary version see Mutex Warning Semaphores must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks Warning To guarantee that the operating system is able to perform proper cleanup no crashes no deadlocks these conditions must be met When a Semaphore s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed no threads must be waiting on it When a Thread s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed it must not be waiting on any semaphore Tutorials Using multiple threads Thread safe APIs Methods void post bool try_wait void wait Method Descriptions void post Lowers the Semaphore allowing one more thread in bool try_wait Like wait but won t block so if the value is zero fails immediately and returns false If non zero it returns true to report success void wait Waits for the Semaphore if its value is zero blocks until non zero User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before submitting a comment Up to date This page is up to date for Godot 4 3 If you still find outdated information please open an issue SkinReference Inherits RefCounted Object A reference counted holder object for a skeleton RID used in the RenderingServer Description An internal object containing a mapping from a Skin used within the context of a particular MeshInstance3D to refer to the skeleton s RID in the RenderingServer See also MeshInstance3D get_skin_reference and RenderingServer instance_attach_skeleton Note that despite the similar naming the skeleton RID used in the RenderingServer does not have a direct one to one correspondence to a Skeleton3D node In particular a Skeleton3D node with no MeshInstance3D children may be unknown to the RenderingServer On the other hand a Skeleton3D with multiple MeshInstance3D nodes which each have different MeshInstance3D skin objects may have multiple SkinReference instances and hence multiple skeleton RID s Methods RID get_skeleton const Skin get_skin const Method Descriptions RID get_skeleton const Returns the RID owned by this SkinReference as returned by RenderingServer

stream peer that handles GZIP and deflate compression decompression Description This class allows to compress or decompress data using GZIP deflate in a streaming fashion This is particularly useful when compressing or decompressing files that have to be sent through the network without needing to allocate them all in memory After starting the stream via start_compression or start_decompression calling StreamPeer put_partial_data on this stream will compress or decompress the data writing it to the internal buffer Calling StreamPeer get_available_bytes will return the pending bytes in the internal buffer and StreamPeer get_partial_data will retrieve the compressed or decompressed bytes from it When the stream is over you must call finish to ensure the internal buffer is properly flushed make sure to call StreamPeer get_available_bytes on last time to check if more data needs to be read after that Methods void clear Error finish Error start_compression use_deflate bool false

Inherits RefCounted Object Helper tool to create geometry Description The SurfaceTool is used to construct a Mesh by specifying vertex attributes individually It can be used to construct a Mesh from a

calling set_uv or set_color then the last values would be used Vertex attributes must be passed before calling add_vertex Failure to do so will result in an error when committing the vertex information to a mesh Additionally the attributes used before the first vertex is added determine the format of the mesh For example if you only add UVs to the first vertex you cannot add color to any of the subsequent vertices See also ArrayMesh ImmediateMesh and MeshDataTool for procedural geometry generation Note Godot uses clockwise winding order for front faces of triangle primitive modes

from vertices so you do not have to do it manually If flip is true the resulting normals will be inverted generate_normals should be called after generating geometry and before committing the mesh using commit or commit_to_arrays For correct display of normal mapped surfaces you will also have to generate tangents using generate_tangents Note generate_normals only works if the primitive type to be set to Mesh PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES Note generate_normals takes smooth groups into account To generate smooth normals set the smooth group to a value greater than or equal to 0 using set_smooth_group

impact of text rendering A dummy text server is always available at the start of a project Here s how to access it var dummy_text_server TextServerManager find_interface Dummy if dummy_text_server null TextServerManager set_primary_interface dummy_text_server If the other text servers are unneeded they can be removed for i in TextServerManager get_interface_count var text_server TextServerManager get_interface i if text_server dummy_text_server TextServerManager remove_interface text_server Copy to clipboard The command line argument text driver Dummy case sensitive can be used to force the Dummy TextServer on any project User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before submitting a comment Up to date This page is up to date for Godot 4 3 If

simultaneously The use of synchronization via Mutex or Semaphore is advised if working with shared objects Warning To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks when a Thread s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed the following conditions must be met It must not have any Mutex objects locked It must not be waiting on any Semaphore objects wait_to_finish should have

is_alive void set_thread_safety_checks_enabled enabled bool static Sets whether the thread safety checks the engine normally performs in methods of certain classes e g Node should happen on the current thread The default for every thread is that they are enabled as if called with enabled being true Those checks are conservative That means that they will only succeed in considering a call thread safe and therefore allow it to happen if the engine can guarantee such safety Because of that there may be cases where the user may want to disable them enabled being false to make certain operations allowed again By doing so it becomes the user s responsibility to ensure thread safety e g by using Mutex for those objects that are otherwise protected by the engine Note This is an advanced usage of the engine You are advised to use it only if you know what you are doing and there is no safer way Note This is useful for scripts running on either arbitrary Thread objects or tasks submitted to the WorkerThreadPool It doesn t apply to code running during Node group processing where the checks will be always performed Note Even in the case of having disabled the checks in a WorkerThreadPool task there s no need to re enable them at the end The engine will do so Error start callable Callable priority Priority 1 Starts a new Thread that calls callable If the method takes

Time Inherits Object A singleton for working with time data Description The Time singleton allows converting time between various formats and also getting time information from the system This class conforms with as many of the ISO 8601 standards as possible All dates follow the Proleptic Gregorian calendar As such the day before 1582 10 15 is 1582 10 14 not 1582 10 04 The year before 1 AD aka 1 BC is number 0 with the year before that 2 BC being 1 etc Conversion methods assume the same timezone and do not handle timezone conversions or DST automatically Leap seconds are also not handled they must be done manually if desired Suffixes such as Z are not handled you need to strip them away manually When getting time information from the system the time can either be in the local timezone or UTC depending on the utc parameter However the get_unix_time_from_system method always uses UTC as it returns the seconds passed since the Unix epoch Important The _from_system methods use the system clock that the user can manually set Never use this method for precise time calculation since its results are subject to automatic adjustments by the user or the operating system Always use get_ticks_usec or get_ticks_msec for precise time calculation instead since they are guaranteed to be monotonic i e never decrease Methods Dictionary get_date_dict_from_system utc bool false const

be ignored silently float get_unix_time_from_system const Returns the current Unix timestamp in seconds based on the system time in UTC This method is implemented by the operating system and always returns the time in UTC The Unix timestamp is the number of seconds passed since 1970 01 01 at 00 00 00 the Unix epoch Note Unlike other methods that use integer timestamps this method returns the timestamp as a float for sub second precision User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before submitting a comment Up to date This page is up to date for Godot 4 3 If you

Tween Inherits RefCounted Object Lightweight object used for general purpose animation via script using Tweener s Description Tweens are mostly useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be interpolated over a range of values The name tween comes from in betweening an animation technique where you specify keyframes and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them Animating something with a Tween is called tweening Tween is more suited than AnimationPlayer for animations where you don t know the final values in advance For example interpolating a dynamically chosen camera zoom value is best done with a Tween it would be difficult to do the same thing with an AnimationPlayer node Tweens are also more light weight than AnimationPlayer so they are very much suited for simple animations or general tasks that don t require visual tweaking provided by the editor They can be used in a fire and forget manner for some logic that normally would be done by code You can e g make something shoot periodically by using a looped CallbackTweener with a delay A Tween can be created by using either SceneTree create_tween or Node create_tween Tween s created manually i e by using Tween new are invalid and can t be used for tweening values A tween animation is created by adding Tweener s to the Tween object using tween_property tween_interval tween_callback or tween_method GDScript C var tween get_tree create_tween tween tween_property Sprite modulate Color RED 1 tween tween_property Sprite scale Vector2 1 tween tween_callback Sprite queue_free Copy to

Copy to clipboard private Tween _tween public void Animate if _tween null _tween Kill Abort the previous animation _tween CreateTween Copy to clipboard Some Tweener s use transitions and eases The first accepts a TransitionType constant and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled see easings net for some examples The second accepts an EaseType constant and controls where the trans_type is applied to the interpolation in the beginning the end or both If you don t know which transition and easing to pick you can try different TransitionType constants with EASE_IN_OUT and use the one that looks best Tween easing and transition types cheatsheet Note Tweens are not designed to be re used and trying to do so results in an undefined behavior Create a new Tween for each animation and every time you replay an animation from start Keep in mind that Tweens start immediately so only create a Tween when you want to start animating Note The tween is processed after all of

Binds this Tween with the given node Tween s are processed directly by the SceneTree so they run independently of the animated nodes When you bind a Node with the Tween the Tween will halt the animation when the object is not inside tree and the Tween will be automatically killed when the bound object is freed Also TWEEN_PAUSE_BOUND will make the pausing behavior dependent on the bound node For a shorter way to create and bind a Tween you can use Node create_tween Tween chain Used to chain two Tweener s after set_parallel is called with true GDScript C var tween create_tween set_parallel

return value of 1 indicates an infinitely looping Tween and a return value of 0 indicates that the Tween has already finished float get_total_elapsed_time const Returns the total time in seconds the Tween has been animating i e the time since it started not counting pauses etc The time is affected by set_speed_scale and stop will reset it to 0 Note As it results from accumulating frame deltas the time returned after the Tween has finished animating will be slightly greater than the actual Tween duration Variant interpolate_value initial_value Variant delta_value Variant elapsed_time float duration float trans_type TransitionType ease_type EaseType static This method can be used for manual interpolation of a value when you don t want Tween to do animating for you It s similar to GlobalScope lerp but with support for custom transition and easing initial_value is the starting value of the interpolation delta_value is the change of the value in the interpolation i e it s equal to final_value initial_value elapsed_time is the time in seconds that passed after the interpolation started and it s used to control the position of the interpolation E g when it s equal to half of the duration the interpolated value will be halfway between initial and final values This value can also be greater than duration or lower than 0 which will extrapolate the value duration is the total time of the interpolation Note If duration is equal to 0 the method will always return the final value regardless of elapsed_time provided bool is_running Returns whether the Tween is currently running i e it wasn t paused and it s not finished bool is_valid Returns whether the Tween is valid A valid Tween is a Tween contained by the scene tree i e the array from SceneTree

thread especially as they can block for multiple seconds at a time Use threading Networking is physical and messy Packets get lost in transit or get filtered addresses free ports and assigned mappings change and devices may leave or join the network at any time Be mindful of this be diligent when checking and handling errors and handle these gracefully if you can add clear error UI timeouts and re try handling Port mappings may change and be removed at any time and the remote external IP address of the gateway can change likewise You should consider re querying the external IP and try to update refresh the port mapping periodically for example every 5 minutes and on networking failures Not all devices support UPnP and some users disable UPnP support You need to handle this e g documenting and requiring the user to manually forward ports or adding alternative methods of NAT traversal like a relay mirror server or NAT hole punching STUN TURN etc Consider what happens on mapping conflicts Maybe multiple users on the same network would like to play your game at the same time or maybe another application uses the same port Make the port configurable and optimally choose a port automatically re trying with a different port on failure Further reading If you want to know more about UPnP and the Internet Gateway Device IGD and Port Control Protocol PCP specifically Wikipedia is

the default If a port mapping for the given port and protocol combination already exists on that gateway device this method tries to overwrite it If that is not desired you can retrieve the gateway manually with get_gateway and call add_port_mapping on it if any Note that forwarding a well known port below 1024 with UPnP may fail depending on the device Depending on the gateway device if a mapping for that port already exists it will either be updated or it will refuse this command due to that conflict especially if the existing mapping for that port wasn t created via UPnP or points to a different network address or device than this one If port_internal is 0 the default the same port number is used for both the external and the internal port the port value The description desc is

means no duration i e a permanent lease and notably some devices only support these permanent leases Note that whether permanent or not this is only a request and the gateway may still decide at any point to remove the mapping which usually happens on a reboot of the gateway when its external IP address changes or on some models when it detects a port mapping has become inactive i e had no

WebXRInterface Inherits XRInterface RefCounted Object XR interface using WebXR Description WebXR is an open standard that allows creating VR and AR applications that run in the web browser As such this interface is only available when running in Web exports WebXR supports a wide range of devices from the very capable like Valve Index HTC Vive Oculus Rift and Quest down to the much less capable like Google Cardboard Oculus Go GearVR or plain smartphones Since WebXR is based on JavaScript it makes extensive use of callbacks which means that WebXRInterface is forced to use signals where other XR interfaces would instead use functions that return a result immediately This makes WebXRInterface quite a bit more complicated to initialize than other XR interfaces Here s the minimum code required to start an immersive VR session extends Node3D var webxr_interface var vr_supported false func _ready We assume this node has a button as a child This button is for the user to consent to entering immersive VR mode Button pressed connect self _on_button_pressed webxr_interface XRServer find_interface WebXR if webxr_interface WebXR uses a lot of asynchronous callbacks so we connect to various signals in order to receive them webxr_interface session_supported connect self _webxr_session_supported webxr_interface session_started connect self _webxr_session_started webxr_interface session_ended connect self _webxr_session_ended webxr_interface session_failed connect self _webxr_session_failed This returns immediately our _webxr_session_supported method which we connected to the

supported webxr_interface requested_reference_space_types bounded floor local floor local In order to use local floor or bounded floor we must also mark the features as required or optional By including hand tracking as an optional feature it will be enabled if supported webxr_interface required_features local floor webxr_interface optional_features bounded floor hand tracking This will return false if we re unable to even request the session however it can still fail asynchronously later in the process so we only know if it s really succeeded or failed when our

Using XRController3D nodes and their XRController3D button_pressed and XRController3D button_released signals This is how controllers are typically handled in XR apps in Godot however this will only work with advanced VR controllers like the Oculus Touch or Index controllers for example Using the select squeeze and related signals This method will work for both advanced VR controllers and non traditional input sources like a tap on the screen a spoken voice command or a button press on the device itself You can use both methods to allow your game or app to support a wider or narrower set of devices and input methods or to allow more advanced interactions with more advanced devices Tutorials How to make a VR game for WebXR with Godot 4 Properties String enabled_features String

WorkerThreadPool singleton allocates a set of Thread s called worker threads on project startup and provides methods for offloading tasks to them This can be used for simple multithreading without having to create Thread s Tasks hold the Callable to be run by the threads WorkerThreadPool can be used to create regular tasks which will be taken by one worker thread or group tasks which can be distributed between multiple worker threads Group tasks execute the Callable multiple times which makes them useful for iterating over a lot of elements such as the enemies in an arena Here s a sample

global_transform of the current XROrigin3D int get_view_count Returns the number of views that need to be rendered for this device 1 for Monoscopic 2 for Stereoscopic bool initialize Call this to initialize this interface The first interface that is initialized is identified as the primary interface and it will be used for rendering output After initializing the interface you want to use you then need to enable the AR VR mode of a viewport and rendering should commence Note You must enable the XR mode on the main viewport for any device that uses the main output of Godot such as for mobile VR If you do this for a platform that handles its own output such as OpenVR Godot will show just one eye without distortion on screen Alternatively you can add a separate viewport node to your scene and enable AR VR on that viewport It will be used to output to the HMD leaving you free to do anything you like in the main window such as using a separate camera as a spectator camera or rendering something completely different While currently not used you can activate additional interfaces You may wish to do this if you want to track controllers from other platforms However at this point in time only one interface can render to an HMD bool is_initialized const Returns true if this interface has been initialized bool is_passthrough_enabled Deprecated Check if

using get_supported_environment_blend_modes instead Returns true if this interface supports passthrough bool set_environment_blend_mode mode EnvironmentBlendMode Sets the active environment blend mode mode is the environment blend mode starting with the next frame Note Not all runtimes support all environment blend modes so it is important to check this at startup For example func _ready var

most important data type in Godot Description In computer programming a Variant class is a class that is designed to store a variety of other types Dynamic programming languages like PHP Lua JavaScript and GDScript like to use them to store variables data on the backend With these Variants properties are able to change value types freely GDScript C var foo 2 foo is dynamically an integer foo Now foo is a string foo RefCounted new foo is an Object var bar int 2 bar is a statically typed integer bar Uh oh I can t make statically typed variables become a different type Copy to clipboard C is statically typed Once a variable has a type it cannot be changed You can use the var keyword to let the compiler infer the type automatically var foo 2 Foo is a 32 bit integer int Be cautious integers in GDScript are 64 bit and the direct C equivalent is long foo foo was and will always be an integer It cannot be turned into a string var boo Boo is a string var ref new RefCounted var is especially useful when used together with a constructor Godot also provides a Variant type that works like a union of all the Variant compatible types Variant fooVar 2 fooVar is dynamically an integer stored as a long in the Variant type fooVar Now fooVar is a string fooVar new RefCounted fooVar is a GodotObject Copy to clipboard Godot tracks all scripting API variables within Variants Without even realizing it you use Variants all the time When a particular language enforces its own rules for keeping data typed then that language is applying its own custom logic over the base Variant scripting API GDScript automatically wrap values in them It keeps all data in plain Variants by default and then optionally enforces custom static typing rules on variable types C is statically typed but uses its own implementation of the Variant type in place of Godot s Variant class when it needs to represent a dynamic value C Variant can be assigned any compatible type implicitly but converting requires an explicit cast The global GlobalScope typeof function returns the enumerated value of the Variant type stored in the current variable see Variant Type GDScript C var foo 2 match typeof foo TYPE_NIL print foo is null TYPE_INT print foo is an integer TYPE_OBJECT Note that Objects are their own special category To get the name of the underlying Object type you need the get_class method print foo is a n s foo get_class inject the class name into a formatted string Note that this does not get the script s class_name global identifier If the class_name is needed use foo get_script get_global_name instead Copy to clipboard Variant foo 2 switch foo VariantType case Variant Type Nil GD Print foo is null break case Variant Type Int GD Print foo is an integer break case Variant Type Object Note that Objects are their own special category You can convert a Variant to a GodotObject and use reflection to get its name GD Print foo is a n foo AsGodotObject GetType Name break Copy to clipboard A Variant takes up only 20 bytes and can store almost any engine datatype inside of it Variants are rarely used to hold information for long periods of time Instead they are used mainly for communication editing serialization and moving data around Godot has specifically invested in making its Variant class as flexible as possible so much so that it is used for a multitude of operations to facilitate communication between all of Godot s systems A Variant Can store almost any datatype Can perform operations between many variants GDScript uses Variant as its atomic native datatype Can be hashed so it can be compared quickly to other variants Can be used to convert safely between datatypes Can be used to abstract calling methods and their arguments Godot exports all its functions through variants Can be used to defer calls or move data between threads Can be serialized as binary and stored to disk or transferred via network Can be serialized to text and use it for printing values and editable settings Can work as an exported property so the editor can edit it universally Can be used for dictionaries arrays parsers etc Containers Array and Dictionary Both are implemented using variants A Dictionary can match any datatype used as key to any other datatype An Array just holds an array of Variants Of course a Variant can also hold a Dictionary and an Array inside making it even more flexible Modifications to a container will modify all references to it A Mutex should be created to lock it if multi threaded access is desired Note There are notable differences when using this API with C See C API differences to GDScript for more information Tutorials Variant class introduction User contributed notes Please read the User contributed notes policy before submitting

represents an axis aligned bounding box in a 3D space It is defined by its position and size which are Vector3 It is frequently used for fast overlap tests see intersects Although AABB itself is axis aligned it can be combined with Transform3D to represent a rotated or skewed bounding box It uses floating point coordinates The 2D counterpart to AABB is Rect2 There is no version of AABB that uses integer coordinates Note Negative values for size are not supported With negative size most AABB methods do not work correctly Use abs to get an equivalent AABB with a non negative size Note In a

position size Setting this point affects the size Vector3 position Vector3 0 0 0 The origin point This is usually the corner on the bottom left and back of the bounding box Vector3 size Vector3 0 0 0 The bounding box s width height and depth starting from position Setting this value also affects the end point Note It s recommended setting the width height and depth to non negative values This is because most methods in Godot assume that the position is the bottom left back corner and the end is the top right forward corner To get an equivalent bounding box with non negative size use abs

back const Returns the last element of the array If the array is empty fails and returns null See also front Note Unlike with the operator array 1 an error is generated without stopping project execution int bsearch value Variant before bool true const Returns the index of value in the sorted array If it cannot be found returns where value should be inserted to keep the array sorted The algorithm used is binary search If before is true as by default the returned index comes before all existing elements equal to value in the array var numbers 2 4 8 10 var idx numbers bsearch 7 numbers

resize with a size of 0 int count value Variant const Returns the number of times an element is in the array Array duplicate deep bool false const Returns a new copy of the array By default a shallow copy is returned all nested Array and Dictionary elements are shared with the original array Modifying them in one array will also affect them in the other If deep is true a deep copy is returned all nested arrays and dictionaries are also duplicated recursively void erase value Variant Finds and removes the first occurrence of value from the array If value does not exist in the array nothing happens To remove an element by index use remove_at instead Note This method shifts every element s index after the removed value back which may have a noticeable performance cost especially on larger arrays Note Erasing elements while iterating over arrays is not supported and will result in unpredictable behavior void fill value Variant Assigns the given value to all elements in the array This method can often be combined with resize to create an array with a given size and initialized elements GDScript C var array array resize 5 array fill 2 print array Prints 2 2 2 2 2 Copy to clipboard

Type For example 7 int and 7 0 float are not considered equal for this method Variant front const Returns the first element of the array If the array is empty fails and returns null See also back Note Unlike with the operator array 0 an error is generated without stopping project execution int get_typed_builtin const Returns the built in Variant type of the typed array as a Variant Type constant If the array is not typed returns GlobalScope TYPE_NIL See also is_typed StringName get_typed_class_name const Returns the built in class name of the typed array if the built in Variant type GlobalScope TYPE_OBJECT Otherwise returns an empty StringName See also is_typed and Object get_class Variant get_typed_script const Returns the Script instance associated with this typed array or null if it does

in operator if 4 in 2 4 6 8 print 4 is here Will be printed Copy to clipboard Note For performance reasons the search is affected by the value s Variant Type For example 7 int and 7 0 float are not considered equal for this method int hash const Returns a hashed 32 bit integer value representing the array and its contents Note Arrays with equal hash values are not guaranteed to be the same as a result of hash collisions On the countrary arrays with different hash values are guaranteed to be different int insert position int value Variant Inserts a new element value at a given index position in the array position should be between 0 and the array s size Returns GlobalScope OK on success or one of the other Error constants if this method fails Note Every element s index after position needs to be shifted forward which may have a noticeable performance cost especially on larger arrays bool is_empty const Returns true if the array is empty See also size bool is_read_only const Returns true if the array is read only See make_read_only In GDScript arrays are automatically read only if declared with the const keyword bool is_same_typed array Array const Returns true if this array is typed the same as the given array See also is_typed bool is_typed const Returns true if the array is typed Typed arrays can only contain elements of a specific type as defined by the typed array constructor The methods of a typed array are still expected to return a generic Variant In GDScript it is possible to define a typed array with static typing var numbers Array float 0 2 4 2 2 0 print numbers is_typed Prints true Copy to clipboard void make_read_only Makes the array read only The array s elements cannot be overridden with different values and their order cannot change Does not apply to nested elements such as dictionaries In GDScript arrays are automatically read only if declared with the const keyword Array map method Callable const Calls the given Callable for each element in the array and returns a new array filled with values returned by the method The method should take one Variant parameter the current array element and can return any Variant func double

any and all Variant max const Returns the maximum value contained in the array if all elements can be compared Otherwise returns null See also min To find the maximum value using a custom comparator you can use reduce Variant min const Returns the minimum value contained in the array if all elements can be compared Otherwise returns null See also max Variant pick_random const Returns a random element from the array Generates an error and returns null if the array is empty GDScript C May print 1 2 3 25 or Hi print 1 2 3 25 Hi pick_random Copy to clipboard var array new Godot Collections Array 1 2 3 25f Hi GD Print array PickRandom May print 1 2 3 25 or Hi Copy to clipboard Note Like many similar functions in the engine such as GlobalScope randi or shuffle this method uses a common global random seed To get a predictable outcome from this method see GlobalScope seed Variant pop_at position int Removes and returns the element of the array at index position If negative position is considered relative to the end of the array Returns null if the array is empty If position is out of bounds an error message is also generated Note This method shifts every element s index after position back which may have a noticeable performance cost especially on larger arrays Variant pop_back Removes and returns the last element of the array Returns null if the array is empty without generating an error See also pop_front Variant pop_front Removes and returns the first element of the array Returns null if the array is empty without generating an error See also pop_back Note This method shifts every other element s index back which may have a noticeable performance cost especially on larger arrays void push_back value Variant Appends an element at the end of the array See also push_front void push_front value Variant Adds an element at the beginning of the array See also push_back Note This method shifts every other element s index forward which may have a noticeable performance cost especially on larger arrays Variant reduce method Callable accum Variant null const Calls the given Callable for each element in array accumulates the result in accum then returns it The method takes two arguments the current value of accum and the current array element If accum is null as by default the iteration will start from the second element with the first one used as initial value of accum func sum accum number return accum number func _ready print 1 2 3 reduce sum 0 Prints 6 print 1 2 3 reduce sum 10 Prints 16 Same as above but using a lambda function print 1 2 3

clipboard See also map filter any and all void remove_at position int Removes the element from the array at the given index position If the index is out of bounds this method fails If you need to return the removed element use pop_at To remove an element by value use erase instead Note This method shifts every element s index after position back which may have a noticeable performance cost especially on larger arrays Note The position cannot be negative To remove an element relative to the end of the array use arr remove_at arr size i 1 To remove the last element from the array use arr resize arr size 1 int resize size int Sets the array s number of elements to size If size is smaller than the array s current size the elements at the end are removed If size is greater new default elements usually null are added depending on the array s type Returns GlobalScope OK on success or one of the other Error constants if this method fails Note Calling this method once and assigning the new values is faster than calling append for every new element void reverse Reverses the order of all elements in the array int rfind what Variant from int 1 const Returns the index of the last occurrence of what in this array or 1 if there are none The search s start can be specified with from continuing to the beginning of the array This method is the reverse of find void shuffle Shuffles all elements of the array in a random order Note Like many similar functions in the engine such as GlobalScope randi or pick_random this method uses a common global random seed To get a predictable outcome from this method see GlobalScope seed int size const Returns the number of elements in the array Empty arrays always return 0 See also is_empty Array slice begin int end int 2147483647 step int 1 deep bool false const Returns a new Array containing this array s elements from index begin inclusive to end exclusive every step elements If either begin or end are negative their value is relative to the end of the array If step is negative this method iterates through the array in reverse returning a slice ordered backwards For this to work begin must be greater than end If deep is true all nested Array and Dictionary elements in the slice are duplicated from the original recursively See also duplicate var letters A B C D E F print letters slice 0 2 Prints A B print letters

The Basis built in Variant type is a 3 3 matrix used to represent 3D rotation scale and shear It is frequently used within a Transform3D A Basis is composed by 3 axis vectors each representing a column of the matrix x y and z The length of each axis Vector3 length influences the basis s scale while the direction of all axes influence the rotation Usually these axes are perpendicular to one another However when you rotate any axis individually the basis becomes sheared Applying a sheared basis to a 3D model will make the model appear distorted A Basis is orthogonal if its axes are perpendicular to each other A basis is normalized if the length of every axis is 1 A basis is uniform if all axes share the same length see get_scale A basis is orthonormal if it is both orthogonal and normalized which allows it to only represent rotations A basis is conformal if it is both orthogonal and uniform which ensures it is not distorted For a general introduction see the Matrices and transforms tutorial Note Godot uses a right handed coordinate system which is a common standard For directions the convention for built in types like Camera3D is for Z to point forward X is right Y is up and Z is back Other objects may use different direction conventions For more information see the 3D asset direction conventions tutorial Note The basis matrices are exposed as column major order which is the same as OpenGL However they are stored internally in row major order which is the same as DirectX Note There are notable differences when using this API with C See C API differences to

as using rotated on the IDENTITY basis With more than one angle consider using from_euler instead Basis Basis from Quaternion Constructs a Basis that only represents rotation from the given Quaternion Note Quaternions only store rotation not scale Because of this conversions from Basis to Quaternion cannot always be reversed Basis Basis x_axis Vector3 y_axis Vector3 z_axis Vector3 Constructs a

Euler angles in degrees as is the case with the Node3D rotation property Quaternion get_rotation_quaternion const Returns this basis s rotation as a Quaternion Note Quatenions are much more suitable

perpendicular to the forward axis The returned basis is orthonormalized see orthonormalized The target and up vectors cannot be Vector3 ZERO and cannot be parallel to each other Basis orthonormalized const Returns the orthonormalized version of this basis An orthonormal basis is both orthogonal the axes are perpendicular to each other and normalized the axes have a length of 1 which also means it

built in boolean type Description The bool is a built in Variant type that may only store one of two values true or false You can imagine it as a switch that can be either turned on or off or as a

Dictionary A built in data structure that holds key value pairs Description Dictionaries are associative containers that contain values referenced by unique keys Dictionaries will preserve the insertion order when adding new entries In other programming languages this data structure is often referred to as a hash map or an associative array You can define a dictionary by placing a comma separated list of key value pairs inside curly braces Creating a dictionary GDScript C var my_dict Creates an empty dictionary var dict_variable_key Another key name var dict_variable_value value2 var another_dict Some key name value1 dict_variable_key dict_variable_value var points_dict White 50 Yellow 75 Orange 100 Alternative Lua style syntax Doesn t require quotes around keys but only string constants can be used as key names Additionally key names must start with a letter or an underscore Here some_key is a string literal not a variable another_dict some_key 42 Copy to clipboard var myDict new Godot Collections Dictionary Creates an empty dictionary var pointsDict new Godot Collections Dictionary White 50 Yellow 75 Orange 100 Copy to clipboard You can access a dictionary s value by referencing its corresponding key In the above example points_dict White will return 50 You can also write points_dict White which is equivalent However you ll have to use the bracket syntax if the key you re accessing the dictionary with isn t a fixed string such as a number or variable GDScript C export_enum White Yellow Orange var my_color String var points_dict White 50 Yellow 75 Orange 100

point numbers Description The float built in type is a 64 bit double precision floating point number equivalent to double in C This type has 14 reliable decimal digits of precision The maximum value of float is approximately 1 79769e308 and the minimum is approximately 1 79769e308 Many methods and properties in the engine use 32 bit single precision floating point numbers instead equivalent to float in C which have 6 reliable decimal digits of precision For data structures such as Vector2 and Vector3 Godot uses 32 bit floating point numbers by default but it can be changed to use 64 bit doubles if Godot is compiled with the precision double option Math done using the float type is not guaranteed to be exact and will often result in small errors You should usually use the GlobalScope

path Description The NodePath built in Variant type represents a path to a node or property in a hierarchy of nodes It is designed to be efficiently passed into many built in methods such as Node get_node Object set_indexed Tween tween_property etc without a hard dependence on the node or property they point to A node path is represented as a String composed of slash separated node names and colon separated property names also called subnames Similar to a filesystem path and are special node names They refer to the parent node and the current node respectively The following examples are paths relative to the current node A Points to the direct child A A B Points to A s child B Points to the current node Points to the parent node C Points to the sibling node C Points to the grandparent node Copy to clipboard A leading slash means the path is absolute and begins from the SceneTree root Points to the SceneTree s root Window root Title May point to the main scene s root node named Title root Global May point to an autoloaded node or scene named Global Copy to clipboard Despite their name node paths may also point to a property position Points to this object s position position x Points to this object s position in the x axis Camera3D rotation y Points to the child Camera3D and its y rotation root size x Points to the root Window and its width Copy to clipboard In some situations it s possible to omit the leading when pointing to an object s property As an example this is the case with Object set_indexed and Tween tween_property as those methods call get_as_property_path under the hood However it s generally recommended to keep the prefix Node paths cannot check whether they are valid and may point to nodes or properties that do not exist Their meaning depends entirely on the context in which they re used You usually do not have to worry about the NodePath type as strings are automatically converted to the type when necessary There are still times when defining node paths is useful For example exported NodePath properties allow you to easily select any node within the currently edited scene They are also automatically updated when moving renaming or deleting nodes in the scene tree editor See also GDScript export_node_path See also StringName which is a similar type designed for optimized strings Note In a boolean context a NodePath will evaluate to false if it is empty NodePath Otherwise a NodePath will always evaluate to true Note There are notable differences when using this API with C See C API differences to

PackedByteArray A packed array of bytes Description An array specifically designed to hold bytes Packs data tightly so it saves memory for large array sizes PackedByteArray also provides methods to encode decode various types to from bytes The way values are encoded is an implementation detail and shouldn t be relied upon when interacting with external apps Note Packed arrays are always passed by reference To get a copy of an array that can be modified independently of the original array use duplicate This is not the case for built in properties and methods The returned packed array of these are a copies and changing it will not affect the original value To update a built in property you need to modify the returned array and then assign it to the property again Note There are

compression_mode int 0 const Returns a new PackedByteArray with the data decompressed Set the compression mode using one of CompressionMode s constants This method only accepts brotli gzip and deflate compression modes This method is potentially slower than decompress as it may have to re allocate its output buffer multiple times while decompressing whereas decompress knows it s output buffer size from the beginning GZIP has a maximal compression ratio of 1032 1 meaning it s very possible for a small compressed payload to decompress to a potentially very large output To guard against this you may provide a maximum size this function is allowed to allocate in bytes via max_output_size Passing 1 will allow for unbounded output If any positive value is passed and the decompression exceeds that amount in bytes then an error will be returned Note Decompression is not guaranteed to work with data not compressed by Godot for example if data compressed with the deflate compression mode

rotations Description The Quaternion built in Variant type is a 4D data structure that represents rotation in the form of a Hamilton convention quaternion Compared to the Basis type which can store both rotation and scale quaternions can only store rotation A Quaternion is composed by 4 floating point components w x y and z These components are very compact in memory and because of this some operations are more efficient and less likely to cause floating point errors Methods such as get_angle get_axis and slerp are faster than their Basis counterparts For a great introduction to quaternions see this video by 3Blue1Brown You do not need to know the math behind quaternions as Godot provides several helper methods that handle it for you These include slerp and spherical_cubic_interpolate as well as the operator Note Quaternions must be normalized before being used for rotation see normalized Note Similarly to Vector2 and Vector3 the components of a quaternion use 32 bit precision by default unlike float which is always 64 bit If double precision is needed compile the engine with the option precision double Note There are notable differences when

Descriptions float angle_to to Quaternion const Returns the angle between this quaternion and to This is the magnitude of the angle you would need to rotate by to get from one to the other Note The

Description This is the built in string Variant type and the one used by GDScript Strings may contain any number of Unicode characters and expose methods useful for manipulating and generating strings Strings are reference counted and use a copy on write approach every modification to a string returns a new String so passing them around is cheap in resources Some string methods have corresponding variations Variations suffixed with n countn findn replacen etc are case insensitive they make no distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters Method variations prefixed with r rfind rsplit etc are reversed and start from the end of the string instead of the beginning Note In a boolean context a string will evaluate to false if it is empty Otherwise a string will always evaluate to true The not operator cannot be used Instead is_empty should be used to check for empty strings Note There are notable differences when using this API with C See C API differences to GDScript for more

the User contributed notes policy before submitting a comment Up to date This page is up to date for Godot 4 3 If you still find outdated information please open an issue StringName A built in type for unique strings Description StringName s are immutable strings designed for general purpose representation of unique names also called string interning Two StringName s with the same value are the same object Comparing them is extremely fast compared to regular String s You will usually pass a String to methods expecting a StringName and it will be automatically converted often at compile time but in rare cases you can construct a StringName ahead of time with the StringName constructor or in GDScript the literal syntax example Manually constructing a StringName allows you to control when the conversion from String occurs or to use the literal and prevent conversions entirely See also NodePath which is a similar concept specifically designed to store pre parsed scene tree paths All of String s methods are available in this class too They convert the StringName into a string and they also return a string This is highly inefficient and should only be used if the string is desired Note In C an explicit conversion to System String is required to use the methods listed on this page Use the ToString method to cast a StringName to a string and then use the equivalent methods in System String or StringExtensions Note In a boolean context a StringName will evaluate to false if it is empty StringName Otherwise a StringName will always evaluate to true The not operator cannot be used Instead is_empty should be used to check for empty StringName s Note There are notable differences when using this API with C See C API differences to GDScript for more information Constructors

It contains three Vector2 values x y and origin Together they can represent translation rotation scale and skew The x and y axes form a 2 2 matrix known as the transform s basis The length of each axis Vector2 length influences the transform s scale while the direction of all axes influence the rotation Usually both axes are perpendicular to one another However when you rotate one axis individually the transform becomes skewed Applying a skewed transform to a 2D sprite will make the sprite appear distorted For a general introduction see the Matrices and transforms tutorial Note Unlike Transform3D there is no 2D equivalent to the Basis type All mentions of basis refer to the x and y components of Transform2D Note There are notable differences when using this API with C See C

context a Vector4 will evaluate to false if it s equal to Vector4 0 0 0 0 Otherwise a Vector4 will always evaluate to true Properties float w 0 0 float x 0 0 float y 0 0 float z 0 0 Constructors
